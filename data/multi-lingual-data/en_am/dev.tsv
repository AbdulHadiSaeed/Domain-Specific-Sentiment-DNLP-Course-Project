1	tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters. love this product. however , i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. but the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging.
1	this has a great rich taste. remember this is ground whole leaf , so the tea is stronger than you may expect. not overly sweet and dissolves readily. i use it during workouts mixed with ice water in a polar bottle.
1	my 7 year old cocker spaniel loves this food and it &apos;s good for him -- he needs to lose a few pounds and this is doing the trick. glad i found it on amazon. hard to find elsewhere.
1	i love these bread mixes. there is nothing like making your own bread. i admit i use a bread maker - not clever enough to use my hands- but i still enjoy the experience. i have tried 2 different hodgson mixes and they are both excellent.
1	our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes. he wasn &apos;t too thrilled with the taste but it did the job : p
0	not the best product for the price. i got these for my dog that has plaque problems but i haven &apos;t really seen any improvement since we got them. they are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque i don &apos;t think they work at all.
1	excellent. we have enjoyed yuban coffee for many years. we recently tried the dark roast coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee. smooth ; with no bitterness. beats the high price of many &quot; gourmet coffees &quot; without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for.
1	i bought this item for my elderly mom , to use with the new keurig coffee machine i purchased for her. she loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! ...... i will be ordering more ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1	this is by far the best decaf i &apos;ve ever tried. you can &apos;t brew it on the large cup setting. you have to brew it on the 8 oz setting , don &apos;t try to stretch it to the 10 oz or it will be too weak. however , when brewed at 8 oz. this is smooth , tasty and tastes like coffee. not bitter and you can &apos;t tell it &apos;s a decaf.
1	forever for the perfect easy peasy gravy mix. this is my fave ! tastes just like the restaurant ones i love so much ; like bob evans , and ihop.
1	i love this body wash. it leaves my skin feeling very soft. it &apos;s not greasy either. worth the extra money to buy the real stuff.
1	these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty. they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.
0	we have ordered uncle rays bbq chips many times before. always been pleased , except this order ! just not the same seasoning as usual. generally lacked much for taste ! not sure if they have reduced the seasoning , in their processing ? but out of case we bought , we have opened and thrown away 3 bags already , very disappointed with this order !
1	soft smooth texture - my little one devours this one ... it is one of the best meat / veg dinners we have found !
0	the chocolate goji berries taste better then the regular goji berries. but i would not recomend them to anyone.they are not worth the money
1	bought this for my mom for her birthday , she was dying to open it so we could all try it. it was nice and fresh and everything tasted great ! wish i had bought one for myself !
0	i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol
1	great product ! wish they were still available in bars , pubs , and stores.have given cans to several of my golf buddies and they agree with me. i &apos;m just glad they are still available on line.
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of the coffee. i have purchased blue mountain coffee before from other places and it was always great. but this was totally unsatisfactory. it had a mildewed flavor to it like it had been stored for a long time in a warehouse that was damp or moldy. for the money i paid for it i was quite displeased and will never buy from them again.
1	this product helped us tremendously. when our 2 year old daughter started day care , she wouldn &apos;t eat at the center and she began losing weight. we started her on pediasure in the mornings as an insurance policy that she was getting enough nutrion. it worked great she stopped losing weight and actually started gaining : ) . she loves the taste , especially the strawberry flavor.
1	all my horses love a sweet reward. dots hold together nicely in the reward bag.
1	i have been using agave nectar for several months now and have found it to be a staple in my home. madhava agave nectar is good tasting , it was a good buy !
1	works great. so much easier to use than the one you buy for the machine. less mess - just throw it away !
1	great product ! all the flavors were delicious. loved the fact that the single serve bags were about 100 calories each.
0	i don &apos;t know if i got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. i think the nantucket blend is good and the dark magic is excellent. my room mate tried it twice and she also thinks the breakfast blend is terrible. green mountain makes some very good coffees but in my experience this isn &apos;t one of them.
1	i found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store. after i bought one bag i found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips. the new york cheddar flavor is so good , you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag.
0	all the chocolate and everything was expired ! ! this was a gift for my brother , and he did not eat any of it !
1	it &apos;s also a routine baking ingredient. i put it into my bread along with sunflower seeds and organic wheat flour. i also put it into my smoothie , stir fry dishes .... anything you can think of ! good price and really , it &apos;s a must have for a healthy diet !
1	it &apos;s difficult to find 20 words to say about mauna loa macadamia nuts , milk chocolate toffee , other than delicious. they didn &apos;t last long. i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s a good thing or a bad thing.
0	ingredients on deep river snacks &apos;s website are : potatoes , sunflower oil and / or corn oil , whey , sea salt , onion powder , sugar , garlic powder , torula yeast , dried parsley , maltodextrix , canola oil , soybean oil , rosemary extract and &quot; natural flavors &quot; . false adversing much ?
1	i just started using this product so i think it is too soon to rate ; however , the order arrived very quickly.
0	the taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the msg. those who are sensitive beware. also , msg addition is usually a way to fake true flavor.
1	pineapple is hands down my favorite flavor of vita coco ! it not only serves a great electrolyte replenishing beverage ( aka the perfect hangover cure ) but it can also be made into a pinacolada if you just add some rum : )
0	they taste more like chemicals than meat. i like a lot of jerky and meat sticks , but would not eat these. the dogs liked them though.
1	i crave these day and night. best cookie / brownie bar i have ever tasted- not too headache-y sweet , but a rich cocoa flavor with a really great texture. they hit the spot. wish they were at more grocery stores !
1	i am in love with this tea. every other apple cinnamon tea i &apos;ve tried has been too cinnamon-y. this is the perfect blend. it tastes like apple cider without all the sugar , which i love. i recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider.
1	we have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won &apos;t eat anything else. she will always eat these. her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.
1	this chips are really good and it &apos;s fun getting the variety pack. now , are they as good as &quot; regular &quot; chips ? probably not , but they &apos;re also not nearly as fattening and bad for you as regular chips. given that these are a healthier version if you want chips , i would highly recommend them !
1	really great snack for hiking or a baseball game .... my son and i enjoy taking them when we go on a road trip to hold us over till we find a good restaurant !
1	actually saves my basil and cilantro for an extra week or two. thats enough reason for me to buy ! before my basil and cilantro would last only a couple days and i would have to toss them out. this saves me money and a trip to the market !
1	my kids loved these and they were such a great deal. i didn &apos;t feel so guilty about giving my kids chips ! !
1	this is not a gourmet chocolate chip cookie , but is the best chocolate chip cookie that we have found in the grocery store. it is not too firm or soft , has a good amount of flavorful chocolate chips , and makes for a nice snack or dessert. we have eaten these for years in my house.
1	fabulous - tasty but not awful for you ! i &apos;ve already recommended to folks i work with. will continue to purchase !
0	it tastes like jack links brand , not wild bill &apos;s. even the texture is totally different from wild bill &apos;s. not recommended !
1	the price is pretty good given that local stores sell one bottle for almost $ 4. don &apos;t know why the price on this has gone up though.
0	i took one sip of this ..... then promptly dumped it into the sink. i &apos;d rather have heartburn - or go without - than drink this bitter coffee. this coffee smelled really good in the package and while it was brewing , so i was excited to taste it. what a shame that it tasted so horrible !
1	these cookies are delicious. my grandaughter ate a whole package the first time she tried them. she has several food allergies and finding a delicious sweet treat is almost impossible. i will be reordering soon because she has gone through the whole box already and has requested more. i am so thankful to have found this product.
1	i was looking for a replacement for timothy &apos;s kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon. this coffee from green mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me. if you like milder coffees , then this one is for you.
1	we use this coffee at my office. people like it a lot and i feel good about it being organic and fair trade.
0	i like this coffee , but $ 37 for two 12-ounce bags ? i can get it online from walmart or even from my local grocery store for $ 7-9 per 12-ounce bag. geez.
1	shipping was really good , and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again , alittle pricy but my little dog likes them.
1	i had tried these at a friends house and loved them , but could not find them anywhere i shop. they are very good for parties or a weekend treat for you and the girls.
1	they all taste really good. it comes in mango , strawberry , and red bean. they are each individually wrapped so you only have to eat one at a time. there are 20 of each flavor as well. when i finish this canister i plan on buying another. * ^ ^ *
1	cool ! i got it last weekend. i was suprised about the pot size , which was a lot bigger than the regular 4 &quot; pots. about the plant , there is nothing to complain. within a week , there are already new leaves !
1	i wanted to make authentic italian margherita pizza at home so i ordered this and caputo &quot; 00 &quot; flour. these tomatoes are amazing , and taste just liek the tomatoes at our favorite italian pizza restaurant. the label says there is basil in it but i did not detect visually or in taste any basil. this stuff is jsut awesome. i ordered another 8 cans. shipping kills though.
0	well , i hope this pumpkin will taste good when i make a pumpkin pie next week. however , i don &apos;t think i would order from them again since 5 of the cans were really badly dented. not just a little ding here or there. bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it. they had to be dented before they were packed because they were inside cans.
0	i didn &apos;t expect this to be so spicy ! it smells great but when you taste it , it &apos;s nasty ! i sweetened it as much as i could but it just didn &apos;t help. this is a shame since i like so many other yogi teas. i &apos;ll have to pawn off the rest to friends and family now : (
1	popchips are absolutely delicious , and getting the variety pack is great. everyone in my family has a favorite flavor. highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving , but are not nearly as bad for you as chips.
1	i like the taste of this coffee. tried the other brands but got stuck on this one , i also like the eco friendliness of the company.
1	i have an old english sheepdog. he absolutely loved the treats. it took him longer than i thought it would to eat through one so i could eat a treat in peace while he chewed on his. it was great.
0	have ordered this brfore and this time just doesnt seem as fresh. when i opened , the contents seemed stale , but the date on the package was oct2013 ..... could have been a pin hole in bag and i couldn &apos;t find it.
0	i do not consider gingerbread , spicy eggnog , caramel apple cider , spiced apple cider summer items .... you cleaned off your self at my expense ! very disappointed !
1	after drinking swiss miss watered down hot chocolates taste for so long , this is a very tasty creamy hot chocolate. my kids love it so i tried it and its the best i had in a while. i will be ordering more.
0	i used to get this at the 7-11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood. when i was little , it came in all flavors. this package was the same product and as good as i remembered , but it was like a multi row of flavors for each bar. when i was little , each bar was a seperate flavor
1	my dogs are very tiny and i needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain , and these did great , plus my dogs enjoyed them. if a dog doesn &apos;t like the taste and won &apos;t chew on a dental stick , then it would defeat the purpose. so these fit the bill all around.
0	this comes in a case of 24 so i bought one can locally before ordering the large amount. good move ! i have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. this review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. haven &apos;t tried the other favors yet.
0	been buying greenies for years. decide to try the senior version but it made my dog sick. i don &apos;t know if its to soft or what but it seemed to get stuck in his throat that he &apos;d eat some grass to throw it up. bummed since i bought a tub.
1	it came promptly , dog is very happy. for some reason , this batch has much smaller pieces than those that we have ordered in the past. i guess the dog thinks that is better he gets more treats at one time ( even though the amout is about the same ) .
1	this is very high qulity pop corn , i recomend it. almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop. very healthy and yummy !
0	i tried contacting the company about never receiving the set , but they just responded &quot; the usps tracking says that the package was delivered. &quot; what a help they were. i did receive a one bottle package later in the week of daves special edition insanity sauce , although i haven &apos;t tried it yet ... i was more excited about the variety in flavor rather than the &quot; hottest-sauce-ever-made. &quot;
1	this gum is my absolute favorite. by purchasing on amazon i can get the savings of large quanities at a very good price. i highly recommend to all gum chewers. plus as you enjoy the peppermint flavor and freshing of breath you are whitening your teeth all at the same time.
0	paul prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. i found the vegetable seasoning to be too spicy.
0	lowrey &apos;s bacon curls pork rinds : 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt , thats all i tasted , a pinch would have been better , or no salt at all.
1	i purchased this coffee for my grandfather , an old vet and lifelong coffee drinker. he thoroughly enjoyed it and we were able to share many stories over a nice pot of gevalia. i would definitely recommend this brand , especially this blend , to anyone that loves a good brew. cheers !
1	i have nothing but good service ever since i started ordering from amazon.com. keep up the good work.
0	my dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however i am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in china. it is not worth the risk to me , sadly to say i will have to find another brand.
1	i buy chicken livers for my cat. she has now learned to speak english persuasively in order to get these treats. ( lol ) they are economical and obviously well liked by my cat.
1	these are absolutely scrumptuous ! my husband and i both love them , however , as another customer put it , they are expensive to ship ! the cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are !
1	a friend brought me this from argentina and my kids and i ate it with a spoon and then apples so that i would feel less guilty. when we finished , i immediately panicked because i wasn &apos;t sure if i could get it here in the u.s. low and behold i found it on amazon. it is different packaging but same company so i assume it is just catering to americans. delicious !
1	this product is as good as any that i have ever used and is so convenient through amazon as it has become hard to find in the stores.
1	great selection of chips &amp; very fresh. if you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips &amp; don &apos;t like the fake taste of baked , these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. i bought 2 cases &amp; every time i &apos;m at target or our super box store i make sure to pick them up ! !
1	this is a great coffee. its dark but not bitter , a little chocolaty , and it reminds me of an adirondack lodge. i can get them for a better price in a caribou coffee store , however.
0	i love annie &apos;s , but this had no taste , very bland and unappealing. i would not purchase this again , but worst of all i &apos;m stuck with 6 boxes ... boo !
1	if i had not purchased this salad dressing myself , i never would have guessed it was fat free. served it with fresh vegetables during thanksgiving pre-dinner , and it was a definite hit with the guests too.
1	slightly crumbly , but overall a very good cookie. in my opinion very similar to chips ahoy but more airy , less dense.
0	this is supposed to be a pretty basic and standard cup of coffee for the krups machine , but was undrinkable. i will take green mountain coffee over this any day. even my husband who is not picky with his coffee at all could not drink this. he even tried putting creamer and sugar and could not disguise the taste.
1	these are so good , my next order will be on the monthly schedule. very easy to make and super delicious. we used milk and chipped ice , along with the mix. i might try water one time to see how that is. i wish i could rate this product higher than 5 stars.
1	this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds ! my fault
1	these are a great value , great size snack to have , or even share , great snack ..... yummy. haven &apos;t tried other flavors , but just might have to.
0	i didnt like these , ended up throwing them away because i thought i was getting more of a chocolate fix out of them than a healthy snack. the berries were dry and crispy - i was expecting maybe a little chewy like a small raisin or something.
0	i purchased these tonight , the package says best by ( dec 2009 ) approximately 3 months from now ... these are horrible ! the aroma is offensive and the taste is even more offensive. i didn &apos;t even finish one piece of the dried peaches. i have tasted other brands that were better , i &apos;m looking for those ! don &apos;t waste your money ! honest !
0	sorry ! the product is great but there is no reason why it should be sold at this outrageous price ... i got the same thing at wegman &apos;s for under 10 dollars ... i just dont understand this price
0	&lt; span class = &quot; tiny &quot; &gt; length : : 2 : 06 mins &lt; / span &gt; -1 star for the price ! -2 stars for the yucky flavor ! enjoy the video ! props to my officemate brendan for filming.
0	coffee is very weak , i have to use 3 packs to make 4 cups of coffee.
1	for those who love salt and vinegar potato chips , this is the one to choose. the flavor is zippy and tart , with no unpleasant chemical aftertaste like the less &quot; natural &quot; versions of this snack. the 2-ounce bags are just right to share at lunch. the chips are a little greasy , and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve given them 4 stars instead of 5.
0	got the wish pearl as a gift. my daughter thought it was a &quot; little disgusting &quot; the mollusk and the necklace to hold the pearl was cheaply made so it wasa struggle to open it. ( we still haven &apos;t gotten it open ) we live at the ocean so my daughter is not sqirmish around sea creatures but didn &apos;t really enjoy this gift.
1	the onion garlic soy nuts are my favorite. they add a great hit of flavor to salads , and the added bonus is they &apos;re good for you.
1	excited to have been able to find this candy as have been looking for ages. was received very quickly and the candy was well packaged and fresh flavor.will buy again. thank you.
0	got the package here in afghanistan. cans were all damaged , but the packaging was intact ? hmmm. the cans that were not damaged went ok. lost 5 in all.
1	it felt weird ordering 24 bags of chips off the internet that i had never even tried before , but i am so glad i did. they are delicious ! i &apos;ve tried 4 flavors so far &amp; have loved each one. these are a win. : )
1	this is by far the best hot cocoa i have found yet for the keurig. i love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. i would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa k-cups. all the other selections for hot cocoa that i have tried were just okay tasting. these are amazing ! ! ! ! love them ! i will order these for sure again !
0	you can order the same products online from nespresso for approx $ 25 and you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items , some of which you may not like. nespresso makes great coffee and great machines. the nespresso capsule offers posted on amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don &apos;t know better.
0	they said the salt and vinegar were horrible ! blecht ! couldn &apos;t get the awful taste out of their mouth. now i &apos;m stuck with this box of popchips ! lol.
0	tastes like dry brownie w / invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.
0	this keeps happening. i get multiple boxes of these delicious k-cup teas but amazon sends out product that will expire in less than six months ! i &apos;m not pleased.
1	this is awesome ! it really helped my daughter gain the much needed weight for a reasonable price. will do business again : )
1	a great way to make cheese biscuits for the celiac. i serve to guests and they cannot believe that my celeiac husband can eat them as they are sooooo good ! ! ! who says gluten free has to taste bad ! ! !
0	the sweet maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion. i was hoping to get the delicious chips that i enjoyed in maui. don &apos;t wast your time.
0	we love the merrick lines of food to mix in with the nature &apos;s variety dried kibble. our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it. they aren &apos;t normally fussy eaters. i have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him , but not this. we &apos;ll stick to wing a lings , turducken and smothered comfort.
1	i received my beans quickly and they smelled great ! i used all of them pretty quickly. i purchased three 1.75 l bottles of vodka and split the beans evenly among them. they were plump and looked great. i &apos;m excited to give my homemade vanilla as christmas gifts.
0	i think i &apos;m not a green tea drinker. this is pretty awful tasting stuff. glad i bought just one bag , because i &apos;m throwing it out.
0	as a vietnamese , i wouldn &apos;t buy this product again. nothing near the korean assi brand of pho that i &apos;ve had before , but which i couldn &apos;t find on amazon.
0	makes okay pancakes. only marginally better than the standard bisquick recipe. they are edible ( i should say that my kids liked them ) . not that great , in my opinion.
1	i got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift. i like that the basket can be reused. i have had the pasta before , so i know it is good. i don &apos;t know how the other items taste.
0	given the recent issues with products made in china i have decided to not buy any food products from there so i won &apos;t be buying anymore of this snack. if they ever switch to made in the u.s. i &apos;ll buy it again as i did like it.
1	i bought thi9s for my dad for a surprise birthday present because he could not find them any where else ! !
1	good product ! good price fast shipping . needs an insert in lid to seal container better !
1	overall the chips were very tastey. my pickey daughter even liked then so that is a real plus for me. some flavors were better but all did meet my expectations. try it and see for yourelf , enjoy.
0	hi , coffee doesn &apos;t smell or taste great. i recommend senseo vienna. still have packages of &quot; paris &quot; and nobody wanna drink it. guess i just have to throw it away.
0	these little cups are a waste of money. the kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup , and as a result i ended up with several half cups of coffee. i tried it about 10 times , and then gave up.
0	okay , decent drinking wines are $ 20 for larger bottles ! what gives ? and don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s because it &apos;s organic and because it &apos;s for japanese cooking. this is the usa where people cook all kinds of ethnic food and they use lots of mirin , when they can find it. btw you can find this exact bottle of eden mirin for 1 / 2 this price and free shipping , elsewhere.
0	our black lab devoured this thing in 10 minutes , and at $ 6 a pop , that &apos;s way too much money for a dog treat. don &apos;t bother getting this.
0	poor product. what was i thinking , looking for mail-order seafood at amazon. buy locally !
1	i really enjoy this disposable. the only thing that would make it better would be for the cups and lids to be made out of a more eco friendly material. coffee tastes great.
1	prince of tea brand teas are great. the premium oolong tea is good , but i found that i like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium , and it generally costs less too. prince of tea is a well known and environmentally concious company and you &apos;ll do well to buy their products.
0	i &apos;ve had many types of pepper jelly , and this is by far the worst ever. the price is high , and the taste is not good. the shipping was outrageous. more costly than the green pepper jelly. don &apos;t waste you money.
1	the flavor of the fruit enclosed is outstanding ( bluberry ) and if there is a drawback it is that the blanket that encloses the fruit is a bit thick ( unlike this companys fig bars ) and pastry textured.flavored with cane syrup ( not fruit juice ) .150 cal per bar , and low in fat and the carbs ( 29 ) not too bad considering the great taste.
0	these took forever to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized. was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy , these were more like a snack.
1	this was the best purchase that i could have made for my daughter. it was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books. thanks so much ! !
1	if you like spicy , then these are for you. i like spicy , so i enjoyed these. they &apos;re also crunchy , as kettle-cooked chips should be.
1	great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have. i &apos;ve tasted several and this by far is the better one , but i have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down. will definitely purchase more , but at the rate my family downs these , we are probably going to stick to the powdered hot cocoa to be more cost effective.
0	the sell by date for our pies is not until february of 2011- but maybe they are getting a little long in the tooth. they taste a little stale to me. the mincemeat is fine , but the crusts aren &apos;t good. i &apos;m a little disappointed. at least they aren &apos;t rancid- but they definitely taste stale.
0	this hazelnut crunch chocolate has big chunks of salt in it. that seems to be what makes it crunchy , not the hazelnuts. ick. the package makes no reference to salt.
1	this is the second time i &apos;ve ordered this product and i plan to order these often. they work perfectly and i am able to use my favorite speciality coffees especially when i run out of the prefilled k-cups sold at retail stores.
1	i love white corn , in all its forms , including popcorn. and i hate how outrageously expensive the kernels are in the supermarket , so i love this popcorn.
0	we found this product to be a very slimy version of jerky. almost like a canned catfood. we couldn &apos;t eat it. the purchasing and delivery etc from the company was good.
1	excellent product and price. would do business with this company again. my cat loves it. can &apos;t wait to plant it again.
0	had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. better off buying the high price truffles.
1	it was wonderful. we made chicken nuggets. it was light and coated the chicken very nicely. i highly encourage you to purchase this. taste pretty much like regular bisquick. has many uses flour , gravy , pancakes .... excellent way to stretch your dollar.
1	my goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. so i decided to try two other brands .... what a mistake. newman &apos;s own is really the best : my dog looks better , feels better , and the quality of food is very good. do not do like i did and experiment around ... my poor dogs stomach .... stick with newmans.
0	my husband and i tried this coffee in place of our favorite dunkin donuts one day and we had to throw out the pot. it was too bitter to drink ! we definitely do not recommend this coffee.
1	if baby likes that &apos;s what matters ! happy baby ! happy mommy ! only thing is the color of food that stain anything , but , oh , well , just washed right the way !
1	this food gets an a rating compared to failing scores for many others in the price range. however , it &apos;s about $ 8 more here on amazon than at the local pet store ( after a 9.25 % sales tax )
1	i have a coton de tulear ... i know ... what is that ? ? ? they &apos;re from madagascar ... quite beautiful , .very spoiled ( of course ) &amp; very finicky ... he just loves these treats
0	i don &apos;t know why this seller is selling this at $ 7.99 , when in harney.com it is being sold at $ 4.00. i happened to double check with the original website. i almost ordered this from this seller through amazon. this tea from harney is 5 star , but this seller is 1 star.
0	was disappointed with this oil. not much flavor and had to use a lot to make up for the lack of taste.
1	this is one of the best hot dogs made , unfortunatally it is not widely available. citymade must be off their rocker if they think people are gonna sale hot dogs for such a crazy price. granted there is 30 + weiners in a package , still a stupid price.
1	we are trying to curb our carbohydrates. the wasa crisp &apos;n light is a big help. especially when you need something crisp. we have and will continue to order this product. thanks amazon for selling this tasty cracker.
0	i ordered the spotted dick. after eating i felt a little strange. i went to the bathroom and to my horror realized that i had this horrible disease. luckily 1 gallon 128 floz tuscan whole milk cleared this up for me.
1	i think these are a bit boring ( i like my cooked peas at least salty and preferably spice-enabled ) but they do undeniably taste like peas , and my toddler begs for them ( &quot; peas ! peas ! &quot; ) . i suspect she likes the crunchiness. i bought a single package to try them out and bought the multi-pack today. i think they &apos;d probably be good in homemade trail mix , too.
1	i love these chips for its unique taste and incredible crispy texture. used to get them at henry &apos;s in san diego , ca before we moved out of there and have been ordering them from amazon since. running out of them constantly !
1	just received my beans today and wow ! there &apos;s an amazing amount for the price paid , they smell absolutely fantastic and came vacuum packed so they &apos;ll keep practically forever.
1	this tea is the best tea i &apos;ve ever had. i first tasted it in norway , and had to find it in the states. i have it every morning.
1	i like strong coffee , but i don &apos;t want it to taste burnt or have an acidic after taste. caribou coffee &apos;s mahogany is full bodied with a nice balance of dark notes and acidity. it &apos;s one of my &quot; go to &quot; coffees when my favorites like coffee people &apos;s wake up call are out of stock.
1	i love my keurig and especially like to fix my iced tea with these kcups. they are very flavorful and every glass is fresh brewed ! i drink iced tea all year so i a glad i found an affordable optuion !
1	i bought this vinegar along with 2 others for my father for christmas. i wish they could have all been shipped together , but they went separately. good vinegar though.
1	ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea. great flavor with no lingering aftertaste.
1	if you enjoy the flavor of soy you will really like this. plus its hand made in the good ole usa.
0	i have been searching for a natural lemonade drink mix that would actually taste good. this is not one of them. did not like the the bitter taste of this drink mix. i can make my own fresh squeezed lemonade better than this stuff. in the mean time i purchase newmans own ready made lemonade if i don &apos;t have the time to make my own lemonade.
1	i really like the pineapple shortcakes sold here. unlike some of the mass-production pineapple shortcakes that use artificial flavoring , tasselfield &apos;s pineapple shortcakes use real pineapples and it makes the whole world difference. you can even taste the fibers from pineapple. i opted for the traditional pineapple this time. i will be interested in trying out the longan or mango variety next time.
1	ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning. very easy and fast to prepare in k-cups.
0	chips ahoy cookies were not very tasty. my children and husband would not eat them. i tried to give them away and everyone refused.
1	we &apos;ve tried many tassimo flavors. this is by far our favorite. our normal cup of coffee is starbuck &apos;s house blend out of a cuisinart pot but one or two days a week we use our tassimo. this coffee is rich but not too stong. i don &apos;t understand the current price over $ 20 for 14 disks and hope that it will be lowered on amazon. for now , we &apos;ll buy elsewhere.
1	i have used pioneer gravy for a number of years. it is very easy to make and tastes great , also. goes very well over mashed potatoes , meats , etc. try it !
1	can &apos;t find them anywhere where i live , so glad i found them here. not too salty or vinegary just the right amount &gt; thanks
1	we are very happy with these organic golden flaxseeds. we grind them and put them in so many things plus they make a great topping for yogurt and cereal in the whole seed form. these are now a staple in our house.
1	this is a keeper flavor -- hope tic tac removes pink grapefruit from the limited edition category. citrus flavor seems especially potent to freshen your mouth after eating onion / garlic.
1	i love the thought that these baby foods are organic. the shipping is quick , well packaged , and easy to open. baby likes all flavors so far of any type of earth &apos;s best baby food. however , this brand is always more watery than any other brand i &apos;ve tried.
1	i was just going to reorder the &quot; bit-o-honey &quot; last me a long time and i enjoy eating it slowly in my mouth ... just like a kid !
1	this product is a must have for celiacs ! the garlic biscuits and pizza crusts you can make are amazing ! !
0	owned two of these and when they work they are fine. the power knob has no indicator on it though. my biggest problem , and the reason i will never purchase another , is this : both gave out with in a year. one now sounds like i am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away. do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option.
0	i made a mistake purchasing this anchor bar original wing sauce online this was slightly over $ 10 a bottle , i was shopping at a super kmart when i came across the same anchor bar original wing sauce for only $ 4.49. this was my own fault i should &apos;ve neve purchased a small bottle of wing sauce no matter what brand for that price $ 10.
0	i have yet to figure out how to get the bottom off to place treats into the toy. so i put them into the top which was difficult and they are hard for the dogs to get out. there are better toys than this one.
1	wow , these are remarkably tasty chips. i discovered them through weight watchers and like the fact that they are low in calories and fat. but they are high in flavor and umami. i am now a big fan !
1	the golf &quot; set &quot; arrived quickly and was just as pictured. the birthday for my five year old grandson turned out great.
1	i love this coffee. i do wish it came already ground as i don &apos;t have a grinder and use a blender instead. but it &apos;s worth it. many flavored coffees i &apos;ve tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn &apos;t reach the coffee , but this one manages both.
0	might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. maybe the other flavors are better , but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $ 1 + a bar.
0	this coffee says dark roast &amp; extra bold and .... it isn &apos;t ! it &apos;s weak and barely beats out a cup of folgers.
1	i keep regular bags and decaf bags in my home at all times. never have to drink old coffee. best way to make iced coffee.
1	i have a friend from england who adores fruitcake. for her birthday i sent her a package of fruitcake. she swooned , fruitcake in june is so decadent. she loves claxton fruitcake so this was a no brainer. now i want some too !
0	i ordered this because amazon recommended it to go along with the redenbacker popcorn popper i got from them. hey , only a few of these actually pop ! most of these small , unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. what an absolute waste of money !
1	these are the best chips i have every tasted they are healthy for4 you &amp; have great flavor i will buy often i eat 1 bag a day with my lunch yummy ! ! !
0	i have been purchasing this product for about 9 months. the taste of the product is inconsistent from lot number to lot number. i have gotten 3 cases where the chips had no flavor at all. have contacted the manufacturer 2 times. have not received a response from my latest inquiry. i don &apos;t recommend purchasing.
1	just tried the doctor kracker seedlander crackers today and they are delicious ! i &apos;m going to try their other flavors soon. can &apos;t believe how good these are.
1	not the best coffee but it is not bad as well. we bought more after we tried the first time because for the price we &apos;ve got it is fine. godiva is still our favorite but this one is okay too.
0	this is the worst chocolate i have ever had. it tastes like anything but chocolate , just a very weird unpleasant taste. i had a piece and threw it in the trash. it only cost a dollar and it was a dollar too much.
0	i have a special needs pet and searched for the right food. since amazon has been a five star resource i chose to have pot pie shipped. many of the cans are dented. so i have to toss them or return. this is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy. best to purchase at the pet store , evidently.
1	i can &apos;t say that biscuits made from this mix taste as good as the regular wheat. but that said , for those of us needing gluten free foods , it &apos;s not bad either.
1	as an ex-brit. steeped ( pun intended ! ) in strong black tea , i wasn &apos;t sure about this , but revolution white pomegranate tea is absolutely delicious , light yet flavorful. the low caffeine content makes it ideal for an evening pot of tea and of course , iced tea. i hesitated to recommend it in case you run out of it !
1	compared to other k-cup products , grove square offers tasty products at a reasonable price. this hot cocoa was rich and delicious !
1	i like eating these whenever i need an energy boost. it has everything that i am searching for in a , &quot; to go snack &quot; . fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing ! ! !
0	i was shopping for sugar-free cookies , so they suggested other sugar-free cookies and i selected them , unfortunately , i &apos;m a diabetic , and when i received the &quot; lucy &quot; chocolate chip cookies : not only were they assorted flavors ( which i didnt order ) but they were not sugar-free ! ! why would they suggest these i have no idea , but i &apos;m very upset.
0	this isn &apos;t nearly as good as the dunkin donuts pumpkin spice coffee i &apos;ve been getting at wal-mart. i particularly didn &apos;t like the bitter aftertaste that i couldn &apos;t adjust out of it. no matter how i brewed it or what i put in it , that bite didn &apos;t go away.
1	i absolutely love the peanut butter and strawberry kind bars ! they taste just like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich !
1	i adore this chowder because it uses natural ingredients and not harmful fillers like msg and partially-hydrogenated oil. most importantly , this chowder tastes mouth-watering good and is bursting with flavor. i use whole milk and add a pinch of pepper , and this aromatic chowder is devoured in minutes. if you have not already , definitely give it a try.
1	these cashews were what i was hoping for , they were large and very fresh. they met my expectations i recommend koeze for anyone looking to purchase these especially if they are a gift. i was not disappointed.
0	this is not disco dust which is edible and made for baking. do not purchase this product for such purposes !
0	unfortunately , all of road &apos;s end &apos;s vegan mac &amp; cheese is really disgusting. not a good taste and the texture of the sauce is really strange. i am really glad that i found leahey &apos;s vegan cheese sauce. it &apos;s amazing and 100 times better than this stuff.
1	this is the best cocoa ever. it beats out anything you can buy in the store. sometimes i just mix it in my coffee and it &apos;s wonderful. highly recommend.
0	mine died one week after it was shipped to me. i just wasted my money on this plant. i should of sent the dead bonsai back to the seller.
1	i purchased the honey stung smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy , i wouldn &apos;t go that far , but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a &apos; snap &apos; to them. the taste is great , even the picky kids liked these smokies-i think we will try some of the other flavors. plus order these again.
0	plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease &apos;s caused by chinese made dog treats. these treats are made in china. plenty of healthy usa made treats available. avoid these at all costs ! ! ! after the latest information was released , i tried to return to amazon , but they said no. please do not buy these &quot; treats &quot; .
1	baby loved this one , but as he has progressed i had to cut this one out because it is too runny and if i have to move the spoon quickly out of the way of his grabby hands , it is all over ! i think they could use a little less water maybe a little more potato to make it more the consistency of the turkey dinner one.
1	i was surprised to learn that amazon sells gevalia coffee , which led me to search amazon for other household items at great prices. i wish all shopping could be this easy. update : 12 / 24 / 11. how can the price go from $ 15.00 to over $ 47.00. yikes i guess no more gevalia for me if that price is correct ?
1	this coffee has a nice flavor , not too bitter , just a nice round coffee taste. rich flavor , naturally decaffeinated with water , and it &apos;s kosher. what &apos;s not to love ?
1	recieved vanilla beans in a nice bundle in a ziploc bag. the smell was wonderful even through the bag. my husband and i used the vanilla beans to make our own vanilla extract. the beans were moist and easy to work with. we were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again. can &apos;t wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out.
1	i &apos;ve tried many gluten free products on the market and this is by far the easiest and more yummiest product yet ! ! thank you betty crocker ! ! !
0	i have always like bustelo espresso regular , and still do. i find very little difference in taste between the bustelo premium and the regular to merit the extra cost.
1	this is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because i use a hot air popper and many of them &quot; jump &quot; out before popping. great flavor , great texture - tender. i do not add anything even though i have purchased three different flavored toppings. thanks ,
0	these pork rinds contain msg which is not stated on the listing. deceptive listing for this product. will not purchase again. shame on amazon for wasting my money.
0	very pretty to drop a few rose buds in a cup of tea but found it to have disappointedly weak rose flavor as a tea itself. perhaps the other rose teas i &apos;ve had were infused with flavoring. not sure.
1	the aroma is amazing , like a walk in my rose garden , minus the bees ... but add a little honey in the tea and there you are. beautiful. taste is smooth , full , delicious.
0	this is the 1st k-cup coffee that i am getting grounds in my coffee. it is occuring about every 3 cups. i have not had this problem with other k cup manufactures. i will not reorder.
1	i tried the cookies and they were great nd trying to find them in the stores with no success. did not realize they were seasonal or would have stocked up great product
1	i had no idea something could taste this good. i &apos;m not really a caramel person , but if i had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet-salty-buttery richness it would be these caramel sea salt squares. i found them at whole foods and they are expensive , but worth every penny. milk is the perfect compliment. get some and you will not be disappointed. you may be ruined for chocolate brownies.
1	this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. the other two that come with it are not worth your money.
1	my 8 month old loves this &amp; has no problem holding it &amp; sucking the food out. this is great for on the go !
0	you get 12 bags for 12.00 , in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. the taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag ..
0	does anyone realize tocopherol usually comes from soy ? i &apos;m still hunting for a cracker i don &apos;t have to make. their website is unclear about it &apos;s source.
0	i was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate. if you want the best , i &apos;ve found that ethel m. &apos; s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you will pay the price !
1	some people mentioned the loose tea is difficult to filter. use a french press made for coffee is a good option - dilute concentrate to desire strength. my favorite flavors are : mango and passion fruit.
1	our cats love the grass. it &apos;s easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually. an excellent product to maintain a cat &apos;s health.
1	i &apos;m a big fan of the dirty martini - but i simply can &apos;t eat enough olives to keep up ! love this stuff - not quite as tangy as dirty sue , but still very vibrant.
0	the only flavor we could stand was the barbecue ( which was the reason we purchased them in the first place ) ! i had to give the others away ! ! ! i won &apos;t be buying this again for lunches although the size / packaging was great. i just wish the other flavors tasted better ( plain , salt , pepper , etc. , weren &apos;t really kid-friendly ) .
1	i recently acquired a bottle of this and was immediately impressed. it has good flavor without all the excessive saltiness of supermarket brands. i &apos;ve used it for marinades and dipping sauces in addition to straight use and in all cases it has added a little something extra. quite a surprise to find an american made soy sauce that tastes this good !
1	arrived quick and on-time , and what a great value ! definitely pleased with my purchase , and will likely buy again = )
1	dop san marzano canned tomatoes are the finest canned tomatoes on the planet ... but i can get these for literally half the price at my local grocery store. is this unusual ? boston is pretty heavily italian in some areas ... maybe that makes a difference. i don &apos;t understand why anyone would buy them at this price. check your local grocery store before you buy them at this price.
0	this coffee supposedly is premium , it tastes watery--very thin. not good at all. maybe old ? ? not sure , it was a waste , and i &apos;m using it line the bottom of my sitting shoes and trash cans and rained-on luggage , to absorb the smells. so i used it , but not to drink. do not buy.
0	can &apos;t tell you how this tastes , because i read the ingredients first , but it has trans-fats in every flavor. : ( the seller should disclose all ingredients in the description. i wouldn &apos;t have purchased this otherwise.
1	i work in college financial aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students. i used to buy them in the grocery store then learned i could get them for less online ( $ 17 for 3lb bag ) and thought that was a good deal - until i found this great deal !
1	this mix is easy to prepare and very tasty. the only prep work consists of cutting up a zucchini which takes less than a minute. the seasoning is excellent , very flavorful but not too spicy. sometimes low-salt mixes are spiced up with a lot of pepper but not this one. excellent for vegetarians.
1	this drink is very good especially after a long hot workout. it quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives. i highly recommend.
1	these arrived fresh and in very good shape , just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door !
1	when i discovered my sensitivity to gluten about 6 months ago , i was dismayed by most of the horrible gluten-free foods on the market. i have since found some substitute foods that are acceptable to me. bisquick gluten-free pancake and baking mix is one of them. i use it every sunday to make either pancakes or waffles. i recommend this mix whole-heartedly !
1	imho. there is simply not a better beverage on earth. since i need to add some more words see prior sentence.
1	not as tasty as the strawberry but still very nice. great to throw in a diaper bag or purse. spendy but definitely a good deal when it &apos;s on sale.
0	this product had live insect larva inside the nuts. the nuts broke to pieces when squeezed with the fingers. i do not recommend this product. i have filed a claim for my refund as frontier has not returned my messages.
1	my daughter that has autism craves hot , spice and pungent foods. these are her absolute favorite chips ! she calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time. i love the crispy kettle way they &apos;re cooked.
1	my 2 cats really like this cat food best of all ! i have regular deliveries in order to be sure to have an ample amount available.
1	jamacian me crazy is sooo good. my husband who normally adds cream to disguise the bitterness drinks it without cream . let my mom and cousin try it and they too love it ! definitely worth trying.
0	i would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts. these are just average quality , and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful. the only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans. there are barely any pecans , but tons of cashews. try another brand as i am sure there is something better out there.
1	my favorite blend of my favorite coffee. used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime i went out to the midwest ! now i can get in k-cups. yay ! good price on amazon , but super saver shipping takes forever ! fedexing it to the post office makes no sense. just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already !
0	i bought this product to keep my boxer entertained. she is very food motivated and very smart. the problem is that she tries to get the food out by any means necessary. this results in her being very ruff on the toy. i had to take it away for fear that she would break it.
0	was so disappointed to discover that happybaby changed super salmon ! my little girl loved the old formula , and it had more protein and calories than this new version. the new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version , and it has a completely different taste and texture - she won &apos;t touch it. we will not be buying it again.
1	i love this popcorn. only downside is the shipping and packing. cost almost as much as the popcorn. need to pack it better. bag split and a bunch of loose popcorn falling out of the box when the guy brought it to my door.
0	packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. however , amazon.com does not let me return it. this is not right ! ! ! ! i have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. buyers should all take a look at it.
1	this is a great source of essential fatty acids without the unpleasant tasting burps of fish oil or flax seed oil , which also doesn &apos;t agree with my stomach. i also think it helps my ibs symptoms.
1	right now i &apos;m mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. they love it. i rotate it around with wheatgrass and rye too
1	i just loved the tea. we just add a little honey and sit back and relax. it has a slight citrus flavor which i find very refresshing.
1	panda licorice is great. it is always received fresh and is much better tasting than the red vines or twizzler brands. i highly recommend a standing order ( approximately every 3 months ) which reduces the overall price per box. amazon is a very reliable and communicative mail order company. aloha !
0	these are a beautiful little tree in a nice planter.problem is it died shortly after we bought it.don &apos;t know whether it was my fault or the plants ! !
1	nothing but good feedback from everyone. a very good classic tasting licorice product. we buy it on subscription and save shipping and a little money.
0	after opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs. most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs. my husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers. i guess we won &apos;t be ordering them this way again. we are both very disappointed.
1	can &apos;t live without these little jewels. not only is there a surprise in the middle , but it takes me right to the french countryside while enjoying them.
1	i love lemon pepper--i was amazed with this one--large grain and fresh. very large jar that delighted me because i use this in nearly everything. good tight jar to keep it fresh. very inexpensive. good buy for home cooks.
1	i have a german breed , g.sheph. &amp; he is very , very , picky ! he loved them. he is such a happy camper. he wakes up in the morning &amp; ready to go for his walks &amp; comes home straight to his treat cabinet , he wants his chicken stix .... thank you , finally something that my boy loves ....
0	this is not a review of the product , but the seller / shipper. i ordered this on september 22nd. it is now october 9th and i still have not received the item.
1	we &apos;ve been drinking yuban since 1979 and find this the most convenient way to get it. the price is great and it faithfully comes every month. if we are having guests we can bump up the order. fantastic.
1	i find it really hard to believe this is gf because it tastes better than any gf product i &apos;ve ever had. i made waffles with it this morning and i didn &apos;t even want butter or syrup ! it was that amazing ! i want proof that this truly gf ...
0	i &apos;m sure this mama grain is pretty healthy but it taste disgusting. even my daughter who is not a picky eater refuse to eat this. the combination of sweet banana and beans doesn &apos;t go well at all.
1	great seller. the product was as described. the seller shipped the product quickly. good , fair price. honey stingers are by far the best training / race day nutrition you can buy. they taste great , easy on the stomach , and organic. i love them.
1	it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you. they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends.
1	found these at a local grocery store and just about fell in love with them. their taste is fresher and most of the seeds live up to their name. i got original , ranch and sizzlin bacon - they &apos;re all great ! when my grocery store told me they got bigs as a one-time deal , i was happy to find them at amazon. if you &apos;re a seeder you &apos;ve gotta try these.
1	i bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and his roomates &apos; dogs. it looked really cute in the package but left the dogs exremely gassy. they are a german shepard , pitbull and a retreiver at fairly large sizes but it was a little rough on the tummy so use lightly.
1	this is the best dog food their is because everything is very. digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it. so it is healther and the best out their far as i &apos;m think
1	this cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry : - ) &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0032jkwgi &quot; &gt; country spoon montmorency red tart cherry juice concentrate 34 oz. &lt; / a &gt; i like this product , and , perhaps , i will order this cherry juice concentrate again.
1	we had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks. we have found enfamil premium to mix easier than the regular enfamil lipil. our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula. i love getting it in bulk from amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula. the price ( with free shipping ) is comparable with local grocery stores in the austin area.
1	these are very good , they were a great price and fast-free shipping when you purchase enough food. the only thing is that the box was smaller than i guessed it would be.
1	great vanilla beans at a great price. i recieved about 60 beans in my pack. they are plump and perfect. when i &apos;ve used them all up i will definitely be buying them again ! i almost didn &apos;t order them because of the reviews talking about the bad smell to them. i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t listen to them. they smell like all of the other vanilla beans that i &apos;ve bought.
1	i love the subcription option at amazon and am using it to get this smooth and non-bitter coffee ! i love it.
1	old mother hubbard treats are the best and at a reasonable price. their treats come in a lot of different sizes and flavors. they offer a variety of products that all dogs will love. my three black labs love the peanut butter and bac &apos;n &quot; cheez.
1	the product arrived on time and is delicious. thanks very much. the price was very fair. what else needs to be said ?
1	the flavor combinations are good and taste pretty good too. i did not give it 5 stars because i thought the consistency of the pears was a bit thin and runny for stage 2. that is easily solved if you mix the fruit with some cereal. my little girl loves them.
1	these chips were a great deal. kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips. they are hard to find in vegas and are my favorite flavor. shipping was very fast , sooner than expected.
1	i was glad i ordered this candy. it still taste like it did 20 years ago.
0	thought these were healthy treats , but found out that they are made in china. noted on back of bag. concerned that it may fall into china made jerky treats suspected to cause kidney problems in pets.
0	i guess the fault &apos;s all my own for thinking that they could get me chocolate through the mail without it all being melted , but that was the case. two packs of truffles all melted. watches out these are highly addictive ! ! ! !
0	i agree with other reviews that the taste is good. but the image on the package suggests mostly lentils with some sauce. it &apos;s not , it &apos;s mostly sauce with few lentils. you could fix this by adding some canned lentils , but you shouldn &apos;t have to. see my picture. it &apos;s like a broth with a tablespoon on beans.
1	just in case you don &apos;t know - these are about $ 4 a box at the store , so anything more than $ 12 for a 3 pack is not worth it. this is a great product , though ( that &apos;s what the 4 stars are for ) . the pancakes &amp; pizza dough are great , i make them all the time.
1	i love this frosting ! it &apos;s sugar free and i cannot find it in stores. i will be ordering more in the future.
0	i like the taste of this dressing , but realized that it contains the additive mono sodium gluconate. this chemical gives me migraines , which is very difficult to tolerate. i am sorry to say that i will no longer purchase this dressing unless they remove this flavor enhancer.
1	i wonder if the other reviewer &apos;s order got mixed up at the warehouse or something ? we received organic juice boxes , just like the title says.
1	the best way to get jelly belly ... a good price .. and you only get the flavor you want.
0	don &apos;t buy these. they are made in china. i found them on a &quot; made in usa &quot; page on amazon but that is incorrect.
0	way too medicinal when mixed solely with water. i finally managed to disguise the flavor when mixing it with lemon-lime gatorade , but i definitely won &apos;t buy this product again.
1	i really like the &quot; crunchy &quot; chocolate chip cookies . . . the soft ones are chemically softened and , i think , gross. these have good flavor and are great for trips ( although eating anything crunchy in the car is discouraged . . . wait for a rest stop ! ) and especially for preschooler snacks.
1	this sauce is very good on anything you cook or grill or you can use it as a dip for veggies etc. it has just enough heat to make everything taste better.
1	she will play with it before eating it. since she is small it acts like a tiny ball for her. they are expensive , but less so at amazon than at a pet store.
1	delicious , pretty good stuff. its sweet and not like chewing on leather like some products i &apos;ve tried. deffinately worth the money and for people who dont like crazy hot jerky but still like a little bite , this is for you
1	awesome tasting tea in a 16 oz. can ! i highly recommend this product because it taste great and doesn &apos;t cost a lot.
1	trying something new with this coffee. didn &apos;t blow me away but for the price , it &apos;s excellent. i don &apos;t have anything bad to say about it other than it &apos;s a big bag and i am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end , but we burn thru beans pretty fast = d
0	i was disappointed in this product because i thought it would be bigger. also , it did not come with enough icing. i had to use my own.
1	this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has 1,100,000 scoville units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely 4,000,000 scoville probaly more like 2,000,000 but i would recommend this product
1	this is the best tasting pancake mix in the market and it is so easy to make.
1	it &apos;s difficult to purchase &quot; no-salt &quot; potato chips at most retail stores , so i ordered a case of 3 ounce bags of uncle rays. they are great. not oily and they taste great. you get the potato flavor instead of just salt. i &apos;ll be buying these from now on !
0	if you need a biscuit fix this is good , but costs too much ( should be 1 / 3 the price ) . a better way is to get the book &apos; carb wars : sugar is the new fat &apos; ( isbn 0979201802 ) and use the cooked gluten flour secret to make your own for much less money. ( the popovers are great ! )
1	after being disgusted by the brown water created by the cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa , we were thrilled to find these dark chocolate cocoa k-cups. delicious !
1	excellent germination ! only 4 days and about 90 % of the seeds are up to an inch. if i hadn &apos;t done this before , the instructions would have been wonderful , they left nothing out. i will buy these again.
0	for anyone liking a weaker coffee , this brand would be fine , but i prefer a stronger coffee so i wouldn &apos;t choose this brand again for that reason.
0	both of my dogs , including the one that eats dirt off the floor , were unimpressed with these treats. the resealable bag is nice , but if the dogs don &apos;t eat the treat it isn &apos;t very helpful. if your dog does like these treats , it is convenient that they come in large wafers that are prescored to break in half for smaller dogs.
1	i have tried different brands of hot cocoa from dark to milk and the grove square milk chocolate k-cups have by far been the best. they &apos;re big critics in my family and they have given two thumbs up. i would recommend anyone who enjoys hot cocoa to purchase this brand.
0	the tea seemed fine but the fragrance oils were too strong for my taste. i could not taste the tea. they need to be more subtle with a green tea. too bad because i am really looking for a good one to replicate the one i usually drink from france which i cannot get any longer.
1	this is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste. i love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar. it &apos;s more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst. the size is perfect for times when you don &apos;t really want a 12 ounce drink.
1	great deal , especially for the price. item arrived quicker than anticipated. this has saved me many trips to dunkin doniuts as well as saving me paying double the price for a cup of hot chocolate that &apos;s just as good. looking for more to stockpile !
1	i have nine cats and they are crazy about these kibbles ! the last thing you want is 20lbs of cat food the cats hate , but i &apos;ll be buying them more of this ...
1	i had no idea there was a gluten free bisquick mix .. i made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also ...
0	so so.there was great reviews on product only made it once will try it again
1	one of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn &apos;t. i put this food on the floor for the chubby guy , and the protein-rich , no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump. the higher food sits going stale. they both really go for this food. and my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week.
1	my kids love these ! they have a great flavor and , for us , are preferred over sharkies. my daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks , but has had no trouble with these.
1	saw this on how it is made , which was a very interesting process. decided to give it a try , i really enjoy the flavor it adds. looking forward to trying it on several more dishes. thanks to those who brewed it !
1	when i &apos;m riding and hit the wall where my legs are just out of gas ( glycogen ) i can eat a pack of these chews and within minutes feel relief and renewed energy ! i never go on a ride without them. oh yeah ... they taste pretty good too.
0	i bought this 4 pack to have some inexpensive caviar to use for garnish over the holidays. the other night i decided to go ahead and use one for some dip. it was so bad i couldn &apos;t believe it. it wasn &apos;t spoiled , it just had an odd flavor with a terrible aftertaste. it didn &apos;t even taste like caviar. i threw the jar away.
1	i hate flavored coffee , unless it is flavored with dark rum ! this coffee is awesome. i got a variety pack of these potful packs and there were ony 3 of 20 that i liked. this is the only one i reordered.
0	i hate to say this , but this snack is terrible. no onion flavor what-so-ever. all it does is gum up your teeth.
1	talk about a versatile new product. drink it hot on a winter morning , drink it iced on a summer afternoon , mix it with your favorite coctail , add it to a marinade , combine it with your your best herbs- i love it all ! it &apos;s smooth and almost silky texture and lack of tannins make it great for anything. how has it taken so long to make it to the states !
1	add walnuts to this healthful brownie and perhaps a light iceing. do not overback or it will be very dry. lots of good stuff in this brownie , but the flax taste is a little strong. i really feel no guilt when having a brownie snack for me or my kids.
0	i have purchased these lemon drops for years and the company ( jelly belly ) has discontinued them. i bought what i thought was them on amazon because they are claiming to be the ones from the jelly belly company ! they are not and very disappointed they were misrepresentd as being the original ... shame on you. i now have 10lbs of junk
0	too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods. i &apos;m trying to follow a low inflammation diet. i do love the taste of goats milk. it &apos;s very rich and creamy. the liquid is better than the powder.
1	very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. i love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. i will be ordering more of this one.
1	instead of simple solution lamb &amp; rice i was sent simple lamb &amp; oatmeal but , my dog likes it. next time i will make sure i am sent the right food. i didn &apos;t know until i had open and put the food in my 10lb container.
0	this product that i recieved was old ... my dogs turned their nose up at it ... my dogs really love this when they are fresh ... these must have been over 1 yr old ... i can &apos;t believe that amazon had sold these ... bad , old , products ...
0	maybe it &apos;s because it &apos;s my first experience with stevia ... but i thought this soda tasted horrible ! i had one can and can &apos;t bring myself to drink another one. we &apos;re donating it to the food pantry , but honestly i feel bad for the people that will have to drink it. i &apos;m normally not harsh with reviews , but i have to say this product is bad.
1	i could get very used to this ! this is a nice , strong , robust coffee without bitterness. the k-cups are so convenient and make no mess.
1	got product on time - early in fact , great experience ! i would order from them again ! very good place to buy these from.
1	the cats love it. i could live without the smell and seeing the pieces of cut up fish in it but the cats love it.wish i would have purchased more the price was right and it is good quality food for them.
0	thanks for the egg tip , it works very well and really helps this product. nevertheless , i ended up giving away three of the six containers because i was not thrilled with the nutritional information.
1	i just went to ralph &apos;s international market , formerly niagara distributing , located at 3701 n. 29th avenue , hollywood , florida , i got 3 pounds of sahlen &apos;s for 15.99 , they also have 5 pounds for 25.99. they have more buffalo favorites , chivetta &apos;s sauce , hot sauce ... check them out !
1	i love these chips and now the whole family is hooked on them. these are the only chips i eat
0	saw these on oprah and ordered them for christmas gifts. the packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn &apos;t help when giving as gifts. saved 2 packages for our family christmas eve treats. i can &apos;t say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake. it has a very strong chocolate taste so i added more milk to tame the taste. these are pretty exprensive so we expected better.
0	i &apos;d not heard of orangina until recently. i found it a refreshing drink , although , a bit pricey making it a nice treat but probably not an every day event.
1	i am so happy that bisquick came out with a gluten free version ! we &apos;ve tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix , and hands down , bisquick is the best ! we just made waffles this morning , and both my husband and i were floored at how good they were ! the outside was crisp and the inside was soft. with that said , it &apos;s not that great for pancakes or coffeecake.
1	its nice to have a &apos; treat &apos; to give my kids that they feel like they are getting soda---they love the taste and i don &apos;t feel like i &apos;m having to compromise any quality ..... i don &apos;t enjoy soda but i do enjoy this product and occasionally will grab a can--great product at a good price !
1	i love this flavor and i cant find it on the shelves anymore. the gum tasted fresh which is actually way better than when i used to buy it in stores !
1	i have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. i find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. it is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. one of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy , which for me it works. this oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. i will definitely continue to purchase it.
1	this is the best coffee we &apos;ve ever had. a light taste but very full bodied. i was very pleased with the packaging , having it resealable keeps it stay fresher much longer and unlike other brands this construction stays intact. i must say you wont be displeased with your purchase , this is a must buy !
1	these dental sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they love them and i like the price for them here at amazon.
0	does not completely disolve in milk , poor flaver , i expected the taste to be better than american produced chocolate drink. one needed substantally more drink powder than american products. i was extremely disappointed , and i would never buy it again. i have used the milka discs in the bosch machine with great results.
1	i was happy to get the disposacups and look forward to using them. i really like the paper filters. i am wondering if the cups can be used again. i know the lid can &apos;t. i will see what happens with this for future uses.
0	i find this product to be too sweet and syrupy and consequently does not quench my thirst. the size is nice but that &apos;s the only thing i liked about it. this is a subjective review of course and other &apos;s may love this product , just not me.
1	i was very pleased when i got these vanilla beans. they were shipped in a timely manner and arrived vacuumed sealed. there was a mix of some very plump beans and a few that were thin. i was very happy with my purchase !
1	there isn &apos;t much to say other than the delivery was great and the candy was fresh and chewy. eating alone the bag lasted me 2 months. great for the price and i &apos;d order again ! ! !
1	i absolutely love the just tomatoes tomatoe slices. i thought the bits might be good for soups etc. , but they don &apos;t seem to have the same sweet flavor of the slices. i will ues these up , but go back to the slices. on the whole , a great product.
0	this tea smells good , but my entire family doesn &apos;t like the flavor. it just doesn &apos;t seem to work and tastes terrible. what a shame , since i really like the idea of this tea. just had to throw the box out !
0	if you are looking for the secret ingredient in robitussin i believe i have found it. i got this in addition to the root beer extract i ordered ( which was good ) and made some cherry soda. the flavor is very medicinal.
1	is so good. lots of flavor and great coffee taste. especially good to wake up with. enjoy this coffee. i give it a plus 10.
1	it &apos;s that good ! heaven if you like cinnamon. tastes sweet with no sugar.
0	while some of their other varieties are ok , this one tastes rancid. also , with any of them , if you reheat the 2nd portion in the container , the plastic coating on the interior crumbles off right into the remaining &apos; oatmeal &apos; ( it is only partially oatmeal ! )
1	i really like this coconut water , but i was surprised that per 17oz box it &apos;s the same price at wegman &apos;s. probably won &apos;t be ordering again unless there &apos;s some sort of discount.
1	dave &apos;s nuts are fantastic - hot , spicy. crunchy , and habit-forming. no babies , frail women , or wimpy men need to order !
0	the taste is not real great and the protein level is really low. i definitely prefer amazing grass green superfood chocolate to this product.
0	i tried many different ways to prepare this green tea ( varying water temperatures with 2 min , 3 min , 4 min boils ) , and yet i couldn ; t get a decent tasting tea with this brand. i &apos;ve been drinking tea for 30 years and i honestly have to say , among the worst i &apos;ve tasted. there is a also a fishy smell to the tea.
0	i can &apos;t figure out why anyone would want to drink this stuff ! ? the can is 1 / 3 less in size than a regular can of soda , it &apos;s got more sugar and more calories and it doesn &apos;t taste very good. it &apos;s also a bit expensive for what your getting ....... need i say more ? ...... i think not !
1	i brought 2 bottles. one i carry in my pocket and the other for home. i fell in love with this while on vacation in belize. just a couple drops does the trick. packs a ton of flavor , but not too hot that it overpowers your food.
1	my daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. it &apos;s exactly what you would expect ... six packages of strawberry twizzlers.
1	my two cats must not be interested in grass , because it grew but they ignored it. had no problems growing it.
1	not gritty like a lot of gf mixes. i make the whole box at once and keep them in the fridge , pop &apos; em in the toaster oven in the morning.
1	i rarely want to eat much when i first arise in the morning ; but i do have coffee. i &apos;ve found that these cinnamon graham crackers work great for me as a little something to eat along with my coffee. they are graham crackers - not anything super-duper amazing - but they are nice , cinnamony graham crackers that are organic.
1	excellent and tasty though i thought not enough garlic so i added more. when i order garlic i guess i expect more of it. but perfect if you have guests as it will never offend anyone. omaha always is sure to do everything to please their customers , a premier company , hard to find anymore.
1	i happen to like foods that arent as sweet as kool aid or other sugary drinks. very refreshing after mowing the lawn and helped keep those afternoon headaches away.
1	delicious and nutritious ! we live for coconut and nut treats since we don &apos;t eat grains. when i want to splurge , i pick up a bag of these from whole foods or my local indie health store. they average around $ 10 here unless they &apos;re on sale. : ) i &apos;d looove to be able to buy these in bulk. yum yum !
0	this is the microwave version of the original. i cannot stand it. the noodles have no flavor at all ; and to me it is not spicy. i will not order any more of this product !
1	i used to buy these at the local supermarket , but they are no longer carried there. finding them on amazon i purchased a box and found they were fresh and delicious as i remembered. for chips they are also very healthy. i definately will buy them again.
0	i found bugs in the packette ! if you dont like bugs you might not want this item.
1	these are not only one of the few pumpkin seeds grown in the usa . they are great and fresh every time.
0	this is some kind of a joke , right ? is this really a $ 60 5 pound bag of flour ? lolololol only in america !
0	sorry , folks , but my pit bull mix destroyed this toy in less than two hours. he even ripped off the top and chipped the indestructible plastic ... if you have a &quot; busy &quot; dog , this is probably not for you.
0	the bag we received from amazon had hollow biscuits and were harder than the ones we purchased from a local store. were these a reject batch ? certainly over baked or dried out ! our bichon had a hard time biting into it.
1	these are delicious and addictive. they are touted as &quot; healthy &quot; but i didn &apos;t see anything particularly healthy in the nutritional list. but they aren &apos;t unhealthy , which is good enough for me. the best thing about them ? costco is carrying them now. can &apos;t vouch for next month.
0	the boxes that i got had more than 50 % raisins. in an average spoonfull of cereal , i got about ~ 4 raisins , which is pretty high. so , if you are looking for a box of raisins rather than cereal , go for this.
1	this is absolutely the best tasting coffee i have ever drank ! i can &apos;t find it locally , thankfully amazon has saved me once again.
0	unfortunately , made in china. i do not trust their manufacturing standards. looking for an alternative ....
1	this product arrived in a timely manner , in good condition , and it was a hit with the family when my son arrived.
1	we are huge fans of earth &apos;s best. my daughter loves them. it &apos;s a great variety. i would definitely reccomend this
1	what a great idea ! ! ! ! my daughter love it. i don &apos;t think is difficult to wash , i mean , is not like just toss water and that &apos;s it ... but , come on ! ! ! ! absolutely recommend it !
0	this product is a waste of money ! it is bitter bitter and salty salty. save your money and by the peaches instead. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0040pyn86 &quot; &gt; libby &apos;s unpeeled apricot halves in pear juice from concentrate , 15-ounce cans ( pack of 12 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	five minutes in , one tentacle was bitten off , ball inside cracked in half. not durable enough to be a dog toy. disappointed : ( . so is the dog : ( .
1	i sent the panda licorice to my brother-in-law who really knows his licorice. he usually buys it by mail specially from one company. his comment was &quot; delicious &quot; .
1	some reviewers must have a short memory. i &apos;ve been eating beer nuts since childhood and the ones i ordered tasted like they always have ( sweet and salty ) . bought them locally until i couldn &apos;t find them anymore. great product and price for 6 / 12oz cans.
0	the dogs love the everlasting products , but this flavor left red stains all over my light carpet.
0	it didn &apos;t taste authentic , or even close to it. it was rather bland and had to be doctored up easy to use which is why i gave it 2 stars , rather than none
1	these are the most fantastic chips i &apos;ve ever had ! i could eat the whole bag myself ! they &apos;re made with lots of whole grain and beans , and make a complete protein , so i have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks. they are great ! the only problem i have with them : the bag is too small ! ! ! we need a bigger bag ! ! : )
0	i wish i had listened to the other bad reviews. the artificial sweetener taste is awful. i gave two stars only because my husband doesn &apos;t seem to mind. i can &apos;t drink this- even if they were a bargain.
1	this coffee is splendid. i can &apos;t say much more. perfect smoothness , not at all bitter .. just the perfect dark coffee.
0	these are not odor free , in fact , they stink more than other bully sticks that we have had in the past. i would not but again.
0	not happy with the product. once they were cooked the potatoes were flat and didn &apos;t look any thing like the product picture that was seen. the shipping cost as much as the potatoes did !
0	we love happy baby products - cereals , puffs , yogurt melts , all the baby food - except gobble gobble. even my 3 year old choked on this. it really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too ! it is extremely dry and thick and lumpy. i cannot believe happy baby manufacturers and sells this stuff , and i can &apos;t believe retailers stock it. do not buy !
0	this tea is the most awful stuff i &apos;ve ever put in my mouth. it has a chemical taste. i tried adding sugar and it didn &apos;t help. i enjoy the arizona pomegranate gree tea and would highly recomment it.
0	nasty smell ; i went back to virbac dental chews. my dogs preferred the v. and even act like they &apos;re treats.
1	this product is so great. my daughter who is extremely pick loves it and she is also gluten free ! ! so she can actually have this ! ! ! ! ! not bad for 100 calories per serving ! ! ! ! ! this will be a great dish to take for thanksgiving dinner.
0	there are much better coffee &apos;s available on the market for far less money that are of significantly higher quality. i was very disappointed in this purchase.
1	the most chocolatey and smooth hot cocoa ever , yum ! it has the best price and taste for the keurig k-cup brewer. way better then at least 3 other peicer brands--we &apos;ve tried different ones and this is the best and super super fast delivery. thanks
0	these sweetleaf &quot; flavored &quot; products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor ( you probably won &apos;t even be able to tell which one it is ) . if you &apos;re looking for a product that &apos;s about half sweetness and half flavor , this isn &apos;t it. i urge you to save your money and look for another solution.
0	i should have read more closely. this is dried packet of mix that can be added to yogurt or milk. not what i wanted. i am going to have give them away to so someone with a &apos; new eater &apos; . missed the mark for me.
1	i love these disposable k-cups as i prefer to use my own brand ( s ) . these accomplish the job perfectly and so easy to use. thankyou for this product. seller was prompt in shipping. good packaging. i will purchase again. a + + + +
0	first time that i received this item with no fizz , still tasted good , but i like the fizz.hopefuly next one will have the sparkling
0	not sure why they decided to mess with a good thing. we &apos;ve cancelled our subscriptions to both the chick chick and salmon happybaby pouches. a huge disappointment to our family as these were two go to meals in our household for our 14 month old. please bring back the old formula , happybaby !
1	so good so perfect so tender so meaty so tasty so delicious you will not be able to eat just one , believe me i have tried. all caps is rude.
1	i visited a winery / vineyard in tuscany where they sold leonardi balsamico vinegar as well as all the wines. the flavor of this balsamic is so difficult to describe but it is smooth ! i was used to grocery store balsamic vinegar and some &quot; specialty &quot; store balsamic vinegars. it &apos;s like comparing skim milk ( yuk ) to cream - which would you rather put in your gourmet dishes ?
1	these cookies are amazing. they taste as good as if not better than the original brands. i only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie.
1	i low orange tictacs and after reading reviews i decided to try these and there almost just as good. orange is still my favorite but cherry is pretty close
1	very tasty and the perfect size snack. reliable in availability and shipping time.
1	my son loves the best earth &apos;s baby food and his favorite seems to be the vegetable and turkey. he smiles at every mouthful. i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. all the food i feed my son is through earth &apos;s best.
1	my dog loves this flavor. quality of cookie overall is very good. this particular smell drives him crazy ! ! on amazon i get much chipper than in a store.
1	i enjoy them a lot and so does my son. i have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. it is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. as for the amount you get in the bag , it is more than i expecting so i was very happy.
1	we had these along with omaha prime rib. both were great. two where plenty to fill up. made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.
1	this kettle chips taste &quot; good , crispy &amp; crunchy &quot; too ! u will enjoy it also ! moreover , it &apos;s thinly cut &amp; sliced !
0	green mountain coffee , nantucket blend is my favorite coffee to use in my keurig brewer. however , in this particular box , the coffee did not taste fresh. perhaps due to the large quantity in one box , it remained in storage too long. at any rate , previous orders from other amazon sellers , like az trading llc and pm trading , and smaller-quantity boxes from amazon.com llc were far superior.
1	based on other amazon reviews , i tried this product. the first shipment was great ; delicious. thought i &apos;d found my new healthful snack. 2nd shipment was a concern and disappointment. even thought of calling the company ; but i didn &apos;t. several different packages had incredibly hard pieces of ? ? wasn &apos;t sure they were almonds. became concerned i &apos;d chip a tooth , so i haven &apos;t ordered any more.
0	dont have a computer.i use my mobile internet.couldnt even get to purchase this.that needs to change.missed out on a purchase.
1	their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet.
0	made in china .. even our dog food has gone the way of the hershey kiss. i won &apos;t be back to this vendor. will be looking for made and sold in america only .....
0	very disappointing. i was expecting black olives. these taste like brown colored off flavor green olives. never again. should work ok in a salad but definatly not what i was expecting.
1	this black truffle oil from italy is fabulous. it &apos;s strong and subtle at the same time. it &apos;s the best deal for exceptional flavor.
1	this is a fantastic product , arrived fresh and it &apos;s a good price with subscribe and save. i will be keeping this subscription.
1	this sauce is an excellent blend of sweet and spicy. i love it with eggrolls , rice , just about anything that needs an extra kick. give it a try !
1	my six month old baby loves the earth &apos;s best 2nd sweet potato chicken dinner - it &apos;s his favorite. he seems to love all the earth &apos;s best 2nd foods - fruits , vegetables , and dinners. the consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick , not too thin.
1	my husband jut loves this coffee ! i purchased it for him and i actually loved it. i am a huge starbucks fan but this also does the job for me. i would highly recommend this product.
1	boy , this was good. the aroma when you first open the package leaves one with great anticipation that you will soon be enjoying a great cup of java. too often times , the result does not meet the expectations. not so with the melitta cafe collection ! the coffee was amongst the best i have ever tasted. treat yourself to a fantastic splurge !
0	delivery was on time but when i opened the product it was like the shelf life expired. they were hard and chewy. i contacted the manufactur and they sent out a new box. i will be ordering direct from now on.
0	these are very colorful but not the best tasting. i used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn &apos;t want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there .... the look was great. i &apos;m sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.
1	my dog loves these treats. i can get him to do anything using them. they were much cheaper using amazon even with the shipping charges.
1	i have two indoor small dogs , poodle and maltese , and they have high anxiety , especially my maltese and these seem to help ! even if it doesnt they sure love &apos; em. my maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it , i think he likes it ! i &apos;d give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey.
1	these are some of my favorite chips on the planet ! they are light , crisp , &amp; not too greasy. the flavor is very dilly. love that ! great chips. just hard to find.
1	and a great price from amazon. my wife and i had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn &apos;t as good as our yuban. i often wonder about starbucks whose coffee i find undrinkable. my son says it &apos;s an acquired taste.
1	this large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. it &apos;s also worth purchasing this larger sized bag ( or get two of them at once ) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time.
1	this juice is actually concentrated as advertised. of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried , this one is the most concentrated , and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin. i guess tart cherry juice tastes like fresh black cherries in general , but montmorency rtcj has the more tart best flavor !
1	i &apos;ve been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid , and i &apos;ve never found a better flavor than hot &amp; spicy chicken ! it isn &apos;t hot at all to a chilihead like me , but it sure is good !
1	this is a fine product. why ? sure , it &apos;s has a flavor that on other tomato has , an earthy taste.
1	never did i think i could put a piece of gum into my mouth and actually experience pie. you can seriously taste the crust , the filling , and even the whipped cream on time. i don &apos;t know how they did it , but it &apos;s amazing.
1	it is great ! i like it alot. great price too. i think it is delicious. top quality product in my opinion.
1	i go for the bold varieties of coffee and this mahogany is not only bold but very smooth. my all time favorite !
1	great for serving chocolate liquor. adds a touch of class to your event and elevates you to host supreme. being able to eat the cup afterwards is just icing on the cake.
1	my daughter says this is the very best hot chocolate she has ever had ! and i love it because no more spilled envelope messes !
1	this hot chocolate is great am so glad i doubled the order , you can not miss with this .now i have quick hot chocolate for the kids and grandkids
0	the cereal in at least one of the three boxes was almost powder. excessive force had been applied although the box was not creased. who knows what happened.
0	these might be ok for hi-protein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels , period. in addition , the bags i received will expire in less than 3 months. i am not pleased.
1	i was looking for holiday sprinkles in bulk and lucked up to find these. i have purchased this brand at williams and sonoma before but always in small containers. i paid the same amount here for the bulk package. i am very happy.
1	my 72 lb dog has never refused to eat newman &apos;s own organic. i &apos;m glad that there is a pet food made without &apos; junk &apos; that i can feed my pet.
1	this is really good. tender , a little sweet. easy to make in the whirley pop , and excellent with some cheddar &amp; spice popcorn seasoning !
0	the picture and description was pure butter mini shortbread round , then i decided to order it because i love them so bad. but when i got the package , it came out at mini chocolate chip shortbread which i don &apos;t like.
0	i just bought this item , 30-may-09 , at my local supermarket for $ 4.29 per unit. how can it list for over $ 14.00 and be discounted on your site for over $ 7.00 ?
1	we use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits , pancakes , etc. tastes good &amp; lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family.
0	this toy is very frustrating , for a dog and for the owner. it makes my dog rather hyper and makes her bark too much. there &apos;s nothing wrong with the manufacture of the toy ; i just don &apos;t think it works well as a device to keep a dog happily busy.
0	i love popchips. however , i did not like this flavor at all. the garlic flavor was too intense.
1	i couldn &apos;t be more pleased with my purchase. vanilla beans are $ 5 - $ 9 a piece if you can find them in the store. these work out to about 51 cents a piece and they are fresher and better quality than the $ 5 ones. they also come vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag is included for storage after opening. good job !
1	finally , a product that gives you that extra boost you need for anything from travel delays to the overdue stack of paperwork. you feel the effects instantly with more energy and a higher concentration level. it stays with you and does not leave you feeling dopey or spent when it wears off.
1	what can i say. it &apos;s our favorite brand of coffee , it &apos;s affordable , and it &apos;s delivered to our door ! i think that pretty much sums it up.
1	the product is great ... but it is priced nearly twice what it retails for in local markets. i dont mind paying a little for convenience of home delivery , but this is too much
1	pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut. i &apos;d like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the &quot; natural coconut water &quot; means. the tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage. the fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy , but it &apos;s still tasty.
1	fast and great service , my cavashon loves this low fat dog food. thanks. arrived in great condition , thank you thank you thank you
0	i really wanted these to taste good , but there is something in there that is very bitter. i had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. no one would eat them. they looked delicious after baking and they &apos;re healthy , but that &apos;s only if you manage to choke one down. i have tried their gingerbread , corn muffin mix , and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great.
0	i would consider this strong coffee , but what is also strong is the smell and taste of cocoa. i would even say that this is very similar to the flavored coffee ( &quot; cocoa or chocolate &quot; flavored ) i have tried in the past and not a regular blend coffee at all. as such , i cannot recommend this coffee at all.
0	ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together. checked the expiration date and it wasn &apos;t expired. starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.
1	this is a wonderful dark chocolate flavor. much deeper flavor than the milk chocolate. the milk chocolate is good but does not have this deep flavor. will be buying this again. ! ! !
1	i &apos;m on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. good taste and low sodium. i just put a little mustard on them and yum !
1	perfect ! ! they are my favorite because i can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt !
1	the gravey is wonderful. it taste just as good and the one from scratch. except it is not as greasy
1	i love disposakups and i &apos;m so glad that liquibuy provides them to consumers. disposakups are fantastic and the vendor does a very good job communicating with its customers.
1	i normally purchase already-grown containers of cat grass at my local pet store. however , the last few pots developed bugs in them , which just wasn &apos;t sanitary. i bought these seeds from hirts and they grew insanely fast ! my cats love the taste. i &apos;ve already bought another pack so i can re-plant once the cats finish off this batch.
1	i really love this tea and have found that my daughter and daughter-in-law feel the same ! i &apos;ve used the loose leaf tea for years but find the convenience of the bags encouraging.
1	bought as gift for hard to buy for father ... he loved bread said it was delicious ! !
1	have tried a few different peanut brittle &apos;s from amazon and this is by far the best. it is loaded with peanuts plus being in a sealed tin makes it seem fresher wit minimal breakage.
0	i just bought the same two items at my local store for less , except they were not marked value pack.
1	if you like sweetarts and you want them in a bulk amount , this product is for you. the sweetarts came perfectly sealed and in excellent condition. there are no downsides.
0	these treats are much smaller than i thought they would be , and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. for the price , i could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. i gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. but then , they &apos;re not exactly picky.
0	having liked the various types of ghirardelli chocolate and premium hot cocoa &apos;s i decided to try some ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix , chocolate mocha. after trying several cups of this i started to wonder what happened to the ghirardelli chocolate as myself i thought it was overpowered with the coffee taste. not my cup of hot cocoa ! !
1	great variety of fruits , and my 8 month old loved them all. we bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks.
1	i am a fan of black licorice. panda black licorice is simply the best black licorice that i have ever eaten ! well done panda !
1	this soup is like a combination of vegetable , lentil and spanish rice soups. it has a slightly gelid texture , though i never add as much water as i should. 4.5 stars to be exact.
1	this bbq glaze shake &apos;n&apos;bake is great for other meats besides chicken and pork. they made great christmas gifts for grandchildren in college.
1	the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son &apos;s egg allergy. it &apos;s also great for camping or any time you &apos;d like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available.
0	if you expect this to taste like dr peppeper you will be very disappointed like i was. sad to say but this product really needs a taste review before they offer it to the public. do not bother with it.
1	this is an excellent tea , very flavorful - the cinnamon is fresh and powerful , and overall it &apos;s slightly sweet without needing any sugar. excellent with milk or straight.
0	ordered galil roasted chestnuts after watching a dr oz show. we expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted. instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut. horrible tasting. we couldn &apos;t eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
0	i did order two of these items , but they only shipped one ... bad business , why must fight for something that i did paid for in good faith
1	these dinners are as close to perfect as can be found here in the mountains. quick , easy and delicious !
0	our family has liked every other flavored we have tried ( bbq is the best ) . we like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips. i was wrong , no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips. i highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity.
0	i was rather dissapointed with this product. i &apos;ve had lavazza before and remember it being more flavorful. this was very mild. it may be because it was old stock. the &quot; best if used by &quot; date on the bag was 7 months ago. i won &apos;t order it again through amazon for fear that somebody it just getting rid of their old stock through mail order. i &apos;ll find a more reputable store.
0	the flavor of the big easy bold is good. but , about every third cup overflows out the top of the cup making a huge mess. it &apos;s as if the hole on the bottom gets plugged and the remaining coffee has nowhere to go but out the top ... and all over the place. if this happened two or three times i &apos;d give it four stars.
1	panda all natural soft licorice is a great snack for family movie time. we consume it like it was water. it &apos;s the best snack next to popcorn.
1	i found these at a local pet store and couldn &apos;t locate them again. great price and dogs love them. i rec &apos;d my shipment quickly with no problems.
0	we threw this garbage straight in to the trash. as far as our dog was concerned , he would rather eat sticks right of the tree branches than these crummy things.
1	this is food especially designed for cocker spaniels who have a range of health issues ... i have been using this product with three of my dogs and all of them are very happy with it. it also is packaged very well and as a result stays fresh for a long period of time. great product !
1	this makes the best waffles that i have had in years. i will be glad to see more in grocery stores in our area
1	raw , organic , fair trade , tastes great ... what &apos;s not to love ? my hope is that as more people buy their amazing chocolates that the price will come down a bit.
1	very tasty cheese flavor. because of crunch and small pieces ( of mixed size ) , it goes a long way without adding too many calories. a good buy. walt b. , apple valley
1	it took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog : - ) thank you for the newman &apos;s daughter to keeping an awesome company n &apos; caring our pets ! ! ! ! 5 stars !
1	expecting something like fanta or sunkist i was surprised how smooth and subtle switch is. definitely a good combination of refreshment and flavor. love the fact that it doesn &apos;t tast too carbonated.
1	i ordered this because so many people were saying that it was sugar free. it &apos;s not. the first ingredient is &quot; sugar &quot; . it &apos;s too much of a pain to return , so i &apos;ll keep it and drink it ( because it &apos;s a pretty good k-cup hot chocolate ) . i will think twice about ordering it again though. i &apos;d really like to get what i ordered.
0	formula itself is great. works wonders for a baby that spits up but wtf ... why is it so expensive here ? $ 121 for 6 12.9oz cans. that &apos;s $ 20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $ 25. almost double the price ... i don &apos;t get it.
1	took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste. but now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
1	these are very good. they are very close to home made , but when i &apos;m in a hurry , i really appreciate having them at hand.
1	would &apos;ve rated 5 stars if it had more of a vinegar taste. overall , not bad at all , good snack
1	we just love yuban coffee and there is not a store where we live that has yuban for sale. i was delighted to discover that i could order it at amazon.com by the case and always keep it in our pantry. the only thing that could be any better would be that i could get yuban beans so i could grind it myself as i make a pot of coffee.
1	this is what i was looking for and was missing it. the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india. definitely recommend it.
1	very good side dish , easy to make , easy to eat. as others have said , needs a little spice , but other than that they are delicious !
1	this product was everything and more according to the advertisement. i was totally satisfied with my purchase. i recommend to everyone to purchase these chips from this site.
1	these are good but the flavor did not resemble an oreo. i purchased these along with the chips ahoy and those did resemble the flavor of chips ahoy. in my opinion these tasted like animal crackers. i will stick to chips ahoy 100 calorie packs.
0	i love cherries ripe , jammed , dried , any way i can get them. i &apos;ve eaten lot of different kinds of dried fruit from different providers. these were stale and i ended up throwing them out.
1	i made these recently for a holiday party. i have never seen anything go so fast ! they were very easy to make-- just add a few ingredients , mix , and throw them in the oven. i will definitely be buying and making these again.
0	i ordered this as it is the food i always use and pay $ 52 for the large bag , didn &apos;t realize i was getting the small 4.4 lb bag. this is not a deal. it is higher than i pay at the pet store !
0	a great idea that falls short. bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. the company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. i cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.
1	these fill your own k-cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that doesn &apos;t come in the k-cup variety. they are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready. i also drink a herbal tea that i buy in bulk and now i can make it with my kuerig. would definitely buy again to have on hand.
0	i received my shipment today , and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. i even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. i carefully followed directions for each bag. if i could rate this , a zero i would.
1	almost 150 charms blow pops for less the 10 cents each. these are great for bribing my children and a trip down memory lane.
0	for around $ 9 , i recieved a small box of 8 crickets. i figured it would be like a delicacy , but upon popping one into my mouth- an overpowering vinegar taste along with an undesireably crunchy / non-dissolving texture ( like eating a popcorn seed with vinegar powder ) forced me to promptly spit it out. disgusting , and a huge waste of money.
1	son is gluten free , but not fun and tasty free , so these are great ! ! ! i put his icecream on these for a cool snack. taste good to him too just plain.
1	love this coffee. have bought this flavor and several others in the past. recommend it to everyone. will continue to buy it as long as i can afford to. the french vanilla is excellent as well !
0	unless you really really really like vinegar - avoid ! those chips should have been called &quot; vinegar and sea salt &quot; - not &quot; sea salt and vinegar &quot; .
1	i have been taking this tea twice per day and i am enjoying the way i feel
1	i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping. this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture. thanks again amazon.
0	this popcorn is not what i expected. i have tried other brands with the same packaging where everything is measured for you , but this one was the worse so far. kernels are half the size and so salty you can &apos;t eat it , once it is popped. i am going back to the other brand.
1	like a lot of gluten free foods there is a tendancy to crumble , but these arrived in very good condition. the vanilla flavoring stands out. very good for light snacking or dessert.
1	low calorie and satisfying. these soups are a nice fill in when you don &apos;t want too much but don &apos;t want to be hungry for a few hours.
0	the title of this product is deceptive. it says giant but they are only 1 / 4 of the size of the an actual giant pixy stick. be careful that you know which ones you order since they have the same name. read the size further down the page.
1	i babysit for my good friends &apos; kids , to give them a &apos; date night &apos; every now and again. these things are always in their freezer b / c they know i am a horrible cook. i always thought 3 year olds were picky eaters , but the twin boys beg me to heat up 2nds for them !
1	when you have a craving for a sweet but you don &apos;t won &apos;t too much , this bar is just perfect. it &apos;s yummy.
1	hershey &quot; sugar free caramel filled chocolates &quot; are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies. these are fairly small , but are very tasty. sweetened with splenda , these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause gastric distress. highly recommended ! cfh
1	i decided to try puroast over a year ago because of stomach problems and mouth swelling. puroast did the trick ! plus it tastes great ! couldn &apos;t be happier with it ( although i wish they would bring the organic decaf back ! )
1	my husband is a twizzlers addict. we &apos;ve bought these many times from amazon because we &apos;re government employees living overseas and can &apos;t get them in the country we are assigned to. they &apos;ve always been fresh and tasty , packed well and arrive in a timely manner.
1	refreshing and light. a little on the sweet side but not overly sweet. i enjoyed the orange flavor !
0	these cookies had a horrible taste , nothing like the sesame cookies we get in new jersey. too many flavors competing with the anise. yuck.
1	the best potato chips i &apos;ve ever had at the best price i &apos;ve ever paid. the service was respectable and the shipping free.
1	i really like this tea , but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like robitussin cough syrup. the taste is more subtle than the aroma. overall , this tea tastes good and is a good value. it &apos;s not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea i have ever tasted , but i would purchase it again.
1	very natural flavor. not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you. has a fresh taste of orange / tangerine and the carbonation is great. great taste. i enjoyed this product and would recommend.
0	more of the product in the packing box are leaking out , at least 10 of the single serve packages leak out in the box. with all the creamers i have ordered through you have packages that have leaked all over the box. i am looking at other sources for my product.
1	although i prefer to get my tuna in the foil packages , what i had ordered appears to no longer be available through amazon so i tried these and they are handy and pretty goo eating for one. toss on a salad , or use on bread or toast to add good quality protein.
1	we first had stonewall waffle mix when we received it in a gift basket about a year and half ago. we have been using it ever since. the flavor of the waffles are absolutely out of this world. we won &apos;t ever go back to bisquick for our waffles !
0	it &apos;s a sturdy jug and easy to fill with treats. my dogs , however , do not find it interesting and have spent little to no time playing with it.
1	this is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking , this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen. this is such a cool product ! !
0	i had been well experienced with different brand names to produce mangosteen juice. i do not believe this dynamic health mangosteen gold is made 100 % pure organic mangosteen juice. i am trying to cancel my order ( every other month order ) . i hope the company who produce this juice may double check to ensure this kind of juice contains almost 100 % mangosteen juice. thanks. shawn.
0	i bought this last year-threw it out-i would not buy this for 1 cent-why is amazon selling such an inferior product ? ?
0	i had high hopes for this product when i first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing. the food was easy to prepare at my workplace. however to me , the taste was very oily and flavorless. i &apos;m a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor.
1	these are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips. many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it &apos;s nice to find ones that i can eat. the vinegar flavor is really intense and good.
1	i take it every day. i used to take fish oil but when i made the change to plant based oil for my body , it was like night and day. i felt the change , and loved it.
0	this product replaced pace &apos;s mexican four cheese salsa con queso , which was the best queso dip out there. this new product lacks the flavor of its predecessor had and the new consistency is gross. i was very disappointed pace / campbells replaced a winning product with this &quot; dud &quot; .
1	this is the best pancake mix ! i &apos;ve sent this to several people , and they all love it. the two-pack makes a nice little gift.
1	i bought these to be able to use my favorite coffess and lessen the expensive of the prefilled k-cups. it little bit more time consuming than the prefilled cups , but if you make several at a time , they work great.
0	upon recieving order , boston baked beans were immediately thrown in the trash. it may be a personal preferrence but , they were hard as a rock and not soft at all where the coating is concerned.they were removed from my list. i ordered a good supply but , was really disapointed. not so much in the seller but , in the product.
1	i was looking for snacks to buy in bulk for school lunches and this fit the bill perfectly. it helped that my 7 year old loves chips ahoy , but for convenience alone , this was a great purchase since i have free shipping through amazon prime.
1	thanks to the betty crocker people for this gf option. it makes great pancakes and shortcakes for strawberries too. my onlycomplaint is i wish the box was bigger.
0	this lemon salt is ok , but the salt is not infused with the lemon , the lemon is mixed with salt granuals. so might as well use lemon.
1	cooked in healthy coconut oil that &apos;s why it stays crunchy ! will not give you side effects of vegetable oil - oxidized cholesterol , transfats , rancidity , and free radicals when you eat foods fried in canola soybean or corn oil.
1	the vet recommended rabbit-based food for my cat , and that is difficult to find. she seems to be allergic to chicken and the regular cat food menu. unfortunately , she &apos;s not crazy about this food , but that &apos;s just because she &apos;s a spoiled brat cat.
1	this coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems. the low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day. maybe not as smooth tasting as my usual blend , but i &apos;m so thankful for it. really close in taste.
1	this is our preferred clam chowder . we like the natural taste with lots of potatoes. the only complaint is i think the soup can be creamier. amazon has much better price on this with subscribe and save.
0	i drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - i &apos;m always looking for a new flavor - so i gave it a try - i drank it but i would not order again. steve
1	this jerky is flavorful and tender .. can &apos;t ask for much more. the only problem i have with it , is that it doesn &apos;t last long enough around my house ; )
1	while working as a busboy in a high end resturant in the 1960 &apos;s the resturant ran low on coffee. the manager sent me out to purchase yuban and only yuban saying it was the best ! i have been drinking yuban for nearly 50 years and have always found it to be an exceptionally rich , smoothe columbian coffee. there can only be one ! yuban !
0	some of the cookies were crumbled. i also found out that these cookies routinely sell for $ 2.50 each at walgreens. paying more that $ 4 per for some crubled cookie did not go well. i will not be purchasing this items again.
1	excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule. my fiancee fell in love with my brother in law &apos;s and had to have one ! now , everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more. also like the fact that there &apos;s a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from.
0	i was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of nana &apos;s chocolate munch cookie bars. to me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can &apos;t even cover up. i threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
1	wow ! i am a pepsi-holic and was gaining weight as you can imagine. a little 85 year old woman introduced me to your tea hot. and now with just a little bit of honey and ice i have a nice cool refreshing drink ! !
1	i have been searching for hot sauces and peppers to compliment my cuisine and i finally found it. for those of you that don &apos;t like everything as hot as the insanity sauce , their are others that are less intense in the grouping. for anyone wanting to use these sauces , read the instructions on the bottles. good job dave ! ! !
0	i can &apos;t even give this any stars. nastiest stuff on earth ! tastes like chemicals and medicine with carbination ! will never order it again !
1	i became a fan for dave &apos;s gourmet dave &apos;s burning nuts about 3 years ago. this is a very addicting snack. a hefty dose of heat with just the right amount of saltiness. i &apos;ve introduced them to a number of my co-workers who are now big fans. i have tried the other spicy nut products on the market , but so far , dave &apos;s is by far the champ !
1	it &apos;s difficult to describe herbal type pills. with no quick results it takes blind faith really. i reckon these are ok ? i got what i ordered quickly
0	i purchased 6 boxes as gifts at $ 21 per box. i spent over $ 120.00 and none could be used. every piece was broken and could not be used for the seder. sending a gift that is broken and can &apos;t be used is very embarrassing. also the return window is april 18th which is ridiculous since the matzo was for the first seder which was on april 18th at night.
0	it tastes good and i like it. but too much sugar ! ! excessive sugar makes it attractive , but i doubt it &apos;s good for health. literally , i can find a layer of sugar at the bottom of the bowl ....... for the sake of health , i &apos;ll give it up.
1	these are thin , crisp , fragrant cookies and are very delicious and tasty. they are excellent with a glass of cold almond milk or hot herbal tea. ( my choices ) if you like ginger snaps you will love lars ginger snaps.
1	this is excellent for a baby &apos;s first taste. the pouch size is perfect and it actually lasted me two days , as my baby is still just learning to eat solids , therefore didn &apos;t have it all. the top makes it easy to refasten , so it doesn &apos;t go to waste and can be used again. i love the pouch , it &apos;s easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess.
1	my girlfriend and i bought some of this at stater bros for 4 or 5 bucks. worth every penny. we use this on sandwiches instead of mayo. it is the best stuff. it &apos;s not healthy at all , in fact it is really bad for you , so keep that in mind.
1	if you need gluten free , non-dairy and no egg , pickings are pretty slim. if you use a really sharp serrated knife and work carefully , you can split them successfully. great for mini-pizzas !
0	i was hopeful , but left unsatisfied. the color of the bean grounds says it all ; a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso , even decaf. taste is weak and odd , not rich and solid. certainly not worth the extra $ $ . recommend cafe bustelo instead.
1	you can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates. great flavor , i highly recommend it. you have to try for yourself !
0	just purchased a 50 count box. previous reviews had indicated that there were probblems with the cups and that they &quot; leaked &quot; grounds into the coffee cup. sadly , this is still the case. about 1 in 5 cups is defective.taste is fine as long as you don &apos;t mind chunky coffee. will not be buying this again ! ! !
0	sojo &apos;s diet lacks calcium , and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog. this diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium / phosphorous additive to be safe.
1	this creme brulee is better than some of the better french restaurants i &apos;ve been to. i just wish my local grocery stores would carry it !
0	it taste okay , but they are not soft and the taste doesn &apos;t stay very long. i wouldn &apos;t buy them again.
1	i actually gave these to a local baker for my daughters cupcakes. they looked great. showed up perfectly on white and chocolate icing. in great shape.
0	i may not be an avid tea drinker but i could not stomach the taste of this. i am used to regular green tea or english breakfast. the taste of this brand was terrible
1	i love these chips , i buy the 24 pack once a month. the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.
1	i do not like decaf coffee. i think it has an aftertaste. but , i thought i would give this a try. it truly surprised me. there is a mellow , full bodied taste with very little aftertaste to be found. i will definitely buy it again to reduce the caffein in our household.
1	not as tasty as some of the others out there , but for the bulk , i &apos;d pay again.
1	i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly. great quality , flavor and aroma. can &apos;t beat that its organic !
0	give yourself the gift of buying the regular skippy. although this gives you less fat , there is a distinct taste difference. we will eat what we purchased but i am still in disbelief that such a minimial amount of fat reduction in a product really makes a great pb turn into a yuckky pb ...
1	great low-carb alternative , they arrived fresh , and unbroken , i &apos;m satisfied with amazon and with purchase again.
0	i &apos;m used to cheap tea ( by the way , cheap tea isn &apos;t low quality ) , but this one &apos;s awful. it tastes like very spicy water .. water with tabasco added , essentially. although i did steep the tea bag for about four minutes , there was no depth to the flavor. i finished the cup , but i certainly wouldn &apos;t buy it.
0	the creamer is fine , it was the creamers that had exploded in the box that were the problem. the few that did break open left the whole box covered and sticky. so i had to go and hand wash all of them before putting them out for our staff and clients. simply irritating ...
0	i thought this would be fantastic to keep my puppy busy but she just chewed the knob off the rope insert ( ours was rubber ) and that was that. she won &apos;t play with it at all. she is highly food motivated but this just doesn &apos;t do it for her. give her a bully stick and that &apos;s really something though !
0	consumer reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. i like these crackers , but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved.
1	i drink this delicious tea almost every day. i have yet to find anything like it on the market.
0	these have a great crunch and it &apos;s great that it &apos;s low fat. however , it &apos;s way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like lays. the cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health.
0	i ordered this product and was thrilled it arrived on valentines day. do not buy chocolate from amazon ! it arrived on time , as a gift , but it arrived melted. and , amazon does not allow you to contact them online about non-returnable items , like chocolate , to express your displeasure over the state it arrives in. i &apos;ve never had a problem with amazon before and am very very disappointed !
0	now has a policy to use non-gmo &apos;d products when possible but they can &apos;t guarantee that this product is produced from non-gmo corn. with their low prices and the majority of corn produced in the us is gmo &apos;d , i have to assume it &apos;s a gmo &apos;d product. isn &apos;t that just great ! ! ! ! and , amazon has a no return policy on food items , so i am stuck with it.
0	the picture of this product shows 3 boxes of rice. i received the order today and there is only one box. this means i paid $ 9 for one box of rice. insane ! otherwise , it &apos;s a great product , and i highly recommend it for people wanting to make meals quickly.
0	i brewed a pot of this but found it too strong. stronger than starbucks even. even with extra milk it still had that too strong taste. no acidic aftertaste , but i don &apos;t think many will enjoy its taste.
0	received my syrup broken , was packed very poorly. after salvaging some it tasted almost similar to a cigar. after reading the reviews i thought maybe it was just me , but i didnt bother getting another to try it.
0	the taste of raspberry is pretty much all i get out of this. i do not taste nor smell chocolate ! the raspberry is too overwhelming which ruins the coffee. now i have 2 boxes of this which i &apos;ll probably never finish. i love coffee and hate the fact that this flavor destroys the coffee taste .. and completely leaves out the chocolate !
1	i was skeptical about buying this because all of the other hot cocoa items i &apos;ve purchased for the keurig have been awful. i was pleasantly pleased with this ! it is simply delicious ! i will definitely reorder !
0	i &apos;m a regular stevia user , but this is the first , last , and only time i &apos;ll use this product -- or any stevia product that is artificially flavored or extracted with alcohol. the chemical aftertaste from this product was overpowering and distasteful. for a better stevia product , try steviaclear by sweetleaf -- the only stevia product i use.
1	this is delicious hot chocolate. it is best at 8 oz cup , but can be stretched to 10. and 8oz of strong coffee and you have delicious mocha
0	yuck ! awful and since i expected beans instead of ground coffee , i &apos;m even less impressed. i have a very good quality coffee maker , but this stuff stinks.
0	the pictures make it seem like the box is larger and contains more candy then it actually does ! i thought it would be a lot better with a larger amount of candy ... but its a rip-off !
1	bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn &apos;t had this tea since he was about 9. finally , after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed , i bought him the tea so he &apos;d shut up.
