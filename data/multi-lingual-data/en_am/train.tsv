1	these seeds always grow , unlike some other brands. every single one of my cats totally loves the resulting oat grass. there is nothing else that all five of them all agree on so unanimously. thanks for such a great batch of seeds !
0	my cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money .. it is just sitting in our cabinets. i will donate it to a shelter ...
0	the web information fails to mention the main ingredient is alcohol , with a small percentage as &quot; pure &quot; extract.
1	don &apos;t know why i can &apos;t find these in my supermarket but i can &apos;t. you get pack of 5 when you order. was afraid 5 boxes would last too long. instead found i need to order another 5-pack.
0	i was very disapointed with this item.it does not look like the photo shown , in fact when it came i thought they had made a mistake.the only ( good ? ) thing about this thing is it is indestructable.make sure it is put away after it has been chewed ? on , hitting your toes on this in the middle of the night might cause you to throw it across a room.
1	this tea has surpassed all other breakfast teas in this tea-drinking household. we love it and it really starts the morning off right. perhaps it has more caffeine than our old favorites ? ? the taste is wonderful without any additions and it will remain our tea of choice in the morning and often throughout the day.
0	not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away. for some reason , the result ended up being &quot; gummy &quot; which isn &apos;t something i expected from this type of product.
0	some of these are quite tasty , but all are too salty. way too much sodium. the cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos , quite tasty. parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all , and too salty.
1	my 3 boston terriers love these treats ! they are natural , wholesome and soft enough to break into multiple pieces. we keep a steady supply of them in the house ... i order at least 2 containers at a time since we don &apos;t want to run out. amazon &apos;s seller -- all pets -- has the best price around.
0	expired and broke my daughters braces , she should not have been eating it in the first place lol but they were as stale as a rock ! !
1	popchips are delicious and much healthier than your regular potato chips. i love all the flavors ! ! it &apos;s also nice to get a variety box with single serving bags.
1	this coffee is good. i have tried a lot of hazelnut coffees and this is one of the best i got from amazon. it has a darker and richer flavor than most hazelnut coffee. it was fresh and tasty and the price was great at about $ 6 per pound with subscribe and save. i will order it again
1	this coffee is my favorite. i usually don &apos;t like the taste of coffee and can &apos;t tell the difference between brands , but this stuff tastes different and good. my only complaint is that amazon raised the price recently from 29.70 to 34.42. i still bought it again at the higher price but if it goes any higher i probably won &apos;t.
1	at $ 3.33 a can , these are expensive for what they are , but are well worth it. the mackerel are of very high quality , are well packed , and not overcoooked or smoked. also , since fish is the only meat i eat , i end up having a can almost every day.
1	these soy crisps are an excellent choice for snacking. with 7 grams of protein in each serving , they are so much better for you than potato chips or other snack foods.they have a great flavor , just enough salt , and leave you feeling satisfied -nutritionally and snackwise ! my grandchildren know these crisps are what they will be offered at my house for snacking. i highly recommend them.
1	my celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta. it is by far her favorite. we make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day. she loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite. a must have.
0	i was so excited to receive this. thought i would cut down on the calories. i didn &apos;t like the taste at all. we baked a banana bread and we threw it out. i am going to try again with brownies and add a little bit more. maybe i just did not add enough. i thought it had an after taste though. i will still use it up and try once more.
0	the salt is included with the oil for this popcorn and it is extremely salty. i have a high salt tolerance so unless you like salt more than popcorn , beware.
0	i don &apos;t know why they &apos;re so many good reviews , but this popcorn is terrible ! ! nothing like the movie theatres popcorn ... save your money and stick with microwable bags ! !
0	i bought this product last week for our dogs , within a day both were vomiting and refusing food. our larger dog is doing ok since we stopped feeding them but our little guy is not. taking both to the vet tomorrow along with these treats.
0	i recently bought this food , only to find that it was on the recall list ( for salmonella ) . i had already put it in with some other food , all of which i will now have to throw out. help me out , amazon ?
0	same price as dr. foster &amp; smith.
1	my sister is alergic to wheat so i make her a lot of gluten free foods. i searched local stores and could not find sorghum flour. so i looked on amazon and finally found it. it was all packed wonderfully and arrived perfectly fine and i &apos;m already using it.
0	the solo k-cup works perfectly instead of these. i totally agree with the poor performance review. i also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime i used these ( yes even with the filter ) . the cup is poorly designed. it clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.
1	product was as described. it was shipped promptly and i will be consuming it as part of a medically supervised diet .. it is the only bread that i &apos;m allowed.
0	i bought this tea at stop and shop and it clearly has warnings on it but i didn &apos;t expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. i don &apos;t fancy the flavor of this tea. yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
1	my son was on vacation a couple of years ago and brought back hawaii roaster kona coffee. they have a different technique the way it is grown then most coffees. i thought i would check to see if it was on amazon. this is the best tasting coffee i ever tasted. well worth the money.
0	i was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews , i took a chance. well , no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- chili sauce. now i &apos;m stuck with two huge bottles. sometimes reading the label is really all that matters.
0	my son would rather have no cookie than one of these cookies. the taste is okay. the texture is hard and weird even when microwaved. short shelf life if you are buying in bulk. not absolutely terrible but worse than average. try pamela &apos;s chocolate chip cookies they are wonderful , or try a baking mix.
1	i purchased this 24 pack of big ass soda and only got 23. immediately i was all like &quot; oh man , this is gonna suck ! &quot; . regardless of the quantity error though , it sure kicked some red. everyone in my town absolutely loves it. i highly recommend along with other soda , voltages. -malcom
1	i was very happy with the quick delivery of this product and how fresh the beans were. i am looking forward to my homemade vanilla extract once it is done brewing. i would definitely buy from this seller again.
1	the pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. i especially like that there is no added sugar. this is a welcomed change from other brands.
1	i think these are my favorite cookies ever. really light and creamy. too bad you can no longer find them anywhere for less than two-hundred count ! i don &apos;t think i need that many.
0	unfortunately , my cats didn &apos;t like this flavor. when i feed it , they never finish their food and i have to throw a significant portion of it away ( or give it to my dog , as he &apos;ll eat anything )
0	i thought it had a bitter orange flavor , however my husband and friend liked it.
1	my family is gluten intolerant and we use this product extensively. pancakes , biscuits , waffles , it doesn &apos;t really matter what you need to bake , this mix comes through. this is my go to mix above bob &apos;s and all others we have tried. try a box , follow the instructions for pancakes , and tell me they aren &apos;t awesome ... go ahead ... i dare you.
1	very good clam chowder.not as good as being in maine in a restaurant but much better then other canned chowders
1	the nuts were fresh. the container was fine for the price. because of the quantity that i ordered the freight was marginal.
1	i really love this sugar and price-wise it &apos;s much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else.
0	this soup has no flavor. broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. i was so disappointed.
0	no tea flavor at all. just whole brunch of artifial flavors. it is not returnable. i wasted 20 + bucks.
1	these taste really good. i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. order in cold weather and buy enough to last ! ! !
1	i love these chips ... and my husband does too. he wipes them out before i can get to them. the variety pack is a great way to determine which flavor you like. they are packaged well and always fresh. the bag contains a generous portion. i &apos;ve purchased many times and am never dissapointed.
1	these are the long time classic. not as sweet as honey roasted peanuts , these have just the right balance to go with a nice cold brew. amazon &apos;s price on these is really great.
1	because these are more expensive than some of the other brands. i decided to order since they had great reviews and are a product of the usa. i &apos;m sure glad i did because these are delicious ! my whole family likes them straight out of the package. we &apos;ve not yet taken the time to roast them.
1	my four kids love these , it &apos;s great that there &apos;s zero nasty stuff in it like grocery store &apos; fruit &apos; ( ie total chemical junk ) snacks. a &apos; safe &apos; kid snack !
1	man what can i say , this salsa is the bomb ! ! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude , he &apos;s dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce ! !
1	i enjoy these chips. i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. i think those are better but only slightly , like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag.
0	the coffee is good. however , at least half of these haven &apos;t been sealed correctly. when i brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. not fun to clean. it may have just been the batch we got , but i won &apos;t be ordering these again.
1	love these mints. they melt in your mouth and taste better than any others i have tried. just wish they weren &apos;t so expensive. you can &apos;t eat just one , a couple. they are addictively delicious.
1	i think plocky &apos;s brand as a whole is a cut above in quality but i found these to lack in taste somewhat and be a little greasy.
1	i &apos;m glad i came across the blue icicle ( on amazon othere prices where 60 or more ) before i went on to buy a mic , preamp and source for phantom power. i literally got i all in one at a verrryyy low price. good bargain. i recomend it for anyone with a home studio and deff go buy a xlr cable. plugging a mic deirectly into it wont work so well.
1	pops fully , few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method. small , fluffy kernels , not a lot of &apos; misfires &apos; that are only partially evolved. my wife says they &apos;re a tad too small for her taste , but the kids and i really love this popcorn.
1	grove street has the absolute best hot chocolate for the keurig. you should always have hot chocolate available to soothe away the days anxieties !
0	i expected any canned stuffed grape leaves to be oily &amp; they are &#91; 6 oz oil , 4 lbs stuffed grape leaves &#93; . what i did not expect was for the cans to come from china. like most other americans i get many things that are made in china , but i draw the line at food. their safety standards are low at best.
0	i love sour food but this one i can &apos;t bear. too strong sour taste ... and even when you open the bag , the sour smell is too strong. i don &apos;t like it.
1	happybaby happymunchies baked organic cheese and veggie snack , cheddar cheese / carrot , 1.63 ounces ( pack of 6 ) hello , this is six items should be installed , but i only received a , i with amazon contact but nobody reason i , please verify as soon as possible , give me reissue , thank you ! ! ! !
0	neither of our cats was the least bit impressed with this product. the flakes did arrive as scheduled , but remain unused except for small amounts that were presented to the cats in various ways in hopes that they would find the flakes appealing. no joy.
0	this was the worst food let down of my life ! @ ! this is made from modern junk that they decided to call bonomo turkish taffy because they bought the name. if you want the real thing , my wife is from ohio and we got french chews and they are exact ! even the powder coating.
1	i tried this coffee two years ago and found it much better then other brands of coffee i had had before. since then i have been buying gevalia coffee at amazon. amazon offers a good price , even lower than that on the gevalia online store.
0	bought this product as a gift for my relative in asia but was ashamed that was told by my receiver that it has been expired 3 months ago. it a waste of my money whereby i can &apos;t make refund due to product is not with me.
1	nice small nutritious biscuit. nice pocket size. resealable pouch is a plus as well. will order more in the future.
1	these chips tatse great , and the serving size is good. we especially liked the variety pack with six flavors
1	the last case ( a different brand ) we ordered from amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case. however , the boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini.
0	the orange and lemon peels make this tea very hippy. despite the initial oohing and ahing over the pretty blue flowers , this is a regrettable purchase. i was hoping for a stronger bergamot component than twinings &apos; earl grey but instead i got something that seems very herbal. blech. i disagree with the positive reviews.
1	clean taste and clean energy. packaging is attractive , simple , and elegant as well.sustainable sourcing and organic cert round out the whole package. overall nice product.
0	these treats literally made my dog sick , throwing up everywhere. and it wasn &apos;t a shock when i read the package which stated made in china. weren &apos;t chicken treats for dogs that are made in china recalled ?
1	it &apos;s hard to rate tea. it &apos;s very good tea , but tea nonetheless. however , the company that sells this particular tea was very nice to deal with. they shipped the tea very quickly. i &apos;ll most likely buy from them again when the need arises.
1	fast service and shipping. these little k cups are great as you can use any kind of coffee or tea that you like , at a much reduced price over regular k-cups. easy to use no mess , what &apos;s not to like. if you have coffee maker that uses k-cups you have to try these , it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like.
0	the candy arrived with some white waxy stuff on it ; almost as if it had partially melted at one point. tasted chalky. not interested in a partial refund. next time find a way to make sure candy is not stale.
0	i ordered the large size but received the regular size for dogs 25-50 lbs. my dog is 75 lbs and needs the other size.
1	my pugs are picky eaters and only like the chicken liver which is hard to find. this is a great deal.
0	unfortunately , i was disappointed with this chocolate--too heavily spiced and too sweet ; not enough of that velvety , smooth pure chocolate that i prefer. i have 4 tins that i will give away to friends and family. i &apos;ll be back and will let you know how they like it.
1	i got these for my mom who is always sucking on a cough drop. these are gummi and are minty like a cough drop , she really likes them. a unique gummi creation.
1	numi has a winner here with this tea ! my husband , son and i often share this wonderful tea after dinner. it is very pleasant and the reason they love it , it does not turn bitter after longer steeping , like other teas do !
1	we had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast , no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores.
1	i purchase 2 15 pound bags of 9 lives daily essentials a month for my daughter &apos;s cats. they love it. she says they often gather around the carton and wait for her to open it. they know what &apos;s in there and can &apos;t wait for it to be opened. if the cats love it , we love it. isn &apos;t that how it goes ?
1	we love them ! this is a great 100 calorie snack. i snack on them throughout the day. my husband , and 3 year old enjoys eating them as well.
0	i used to buy the pillsbury mix but i gave this one a try. well , not so good. far too sweet , not much lemon flavor and basically zero poppy seed flavor to it.
1	we love strawberries dipped in chocolate but locally we could not find the dark chocolate type - so glad we found this at amazon - it is wonderful !
1	this is a bold blend that has a great taste. the flavor comes bursting through. i usually brew &amp; drink organic sumatra mandeling from bj &apos;s. i use this blend exclusively , so to get a cup that rivals the complex flavor from my tassimo brewer is fantastic. come on amazon add it to the subscription service.
1	my dogs love these ! ! when i ran out of them recently , they were &quot; counter &quot; sniffing trying to find some. i have a service dog that has to maintain his weight , and these are perfect for him.
0	this is the most pitiful excuse for a bonsai that i have ever seen in my life. it consists of a twig in a cheap plastic pot. nothing at all like the photo. i would never do business with this company again. amazon should be ashamed for dealing with this company !
0	this stuff is just awful. doesn &apos;t taste like chocolate in the slightest. i &apos;ve had very good mexican spiced chocolate that actually tasted like chocolate. this stuff is just a mix of cinnamon and a bunch of other overpowering spices that are not pleasant. i can &apos;t believe this stuff has such good reviews. it &apos;s iky
0	this product is old. the chocolate crumbles and it looks old. maybe not stored properly ? i could not return item as it is a food item and could not conveniently see how to get a refund. we have had this product fresh and it was wonderful. this was not wonderful by any means
1	we make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. sleepytime is the lone exception. we &apos;ve been drinking this tea for many years now and it still rates among our very favorites. it &apos;s the perfect blend of camomile and mint. and you gotta love the bear.
0	this is not a 20 oz bag. it is only 4oz each bag. misleading product. thought i was buying 20oz bags. not very happy. should &apos;ve gone local for 8 dollars per bag.
1	this product is very good. it goes a long way. but quite as good as the one at dd. good product not the less.
0	i use honey in my tea and i was hoping to reduce the carbs with this. it is actually the opposite. both honey and agave have the same carbs per tablespoon and i have to use twice as much as this to get the same sweetness.
1	i &apos;ve been a fan of hot &amp; spicy maruchan ramen for a long time. if you enjoy spice , and love ramen , you &apos;ll love this product. too bad it &apos;s way too expensive here on amazon. it &apos;s only $ 3.36 per 12 at my walmart.
0	these candies are more like chocolate-dipped decorations than anything you should eat. a terribly expensive waste of lovely chocolate. it gets two stars because they are pretty and would last forever without fear of rotting while festively decorating the inside of a candy dish.
1	indoors , outdoors , wherever you go - grandpa po &apos;s originals provide families with a fun , tasty anytime treat ! they &apos;re perfect for playing ; they &apos;re super for school lunches ... &amp; serious snacking , too !
0	the noodles for this product are what make me gag. i am not a fan of this meal at all and i &amp; lt ; 3 asian food. for those looking for a delicious snack who are not already 100 % vegan - i would either a ) go try 1 first or b ) skip buying this package as it is not delicious.
0	the first shipment i received of this item was great. lids fit easily. this last shipment , either the lids are slightly larger or the cups are smaller. the lids are extremely hard to get on. if i press too hard the cup starts to buckle. i &apos;ve actually started to use a pair of pliers to get the lids on !
1	sometimes , i &apos;d rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. this meets my cocoa craving. i do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew !
1	could not stop eating these after the first taste ! high quality ingredients make a big difference. love the crunch and the seeds. the subtle sweetness is nice too , much less heavy-handed than in most products.
1	i &apos;m pregnant and had to , give up my hot cup of coffee. i thought maybe a hot cup of this will suffice ? sure does ! throw the kcup , in- and this is the best hot choc ever ! i choke down my vitamins with it too ! worth it and so cheap here !
0	it is okay. i would not go out of my way to buy it again
1	this is the best cajun seasoning ever ! we use it on seafood , steaks and burgers. seasoning enhances , not overwhelms , whatever it is put on.
0	i &apos;ve tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren &apos;t. if you are desperate for a cracker find another. i rarely throw any food out but i made an exception in this case. it is terrible.
0	i bought the packs after a trip to nyc -- and due to the long wait -- could not get into the restaurant. it was pretty bad. the chocolate had a weird after-taste. i would have been better off making a chocolate milk shake. in order to use up all of the packs , i am going to try to add coffee to the milk to try to mask that funny taste.
1	i was getting tired from washing out the little refillable baskets to make a second cup. the solutions are to get multiple baskets or the disposable type. the filtering is a little better and the coffee has fewer solids. it is easy to use and does what it says.
1	there is nothing better than a huge baked sweet potato with ( real ) butter and splenda brown sugar totally covering the butter and sweet potato , makes me want to fix one right now !
1	this seller is very nice. and the price is very good. the only reason i stop ording is bacause i went to sugar free , and at that time he did not have it. but for those of you that don &apos;t have to watch there fat in take , i would get this product from them.
0	we purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. the pretzels would not have been bad for anything else , but there were way too many broken ones ... we would have had to buy five more barrels. my only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven &apos;t received our refund !
1	we bought this to use with recipes for our tagine. this is an amazing spice and at an excellent price ! will buy from again
1	we have reorderd this product many times ... makes a great dirty martini .. delivery is prompt , product well packed
1	these chips were good. i ended up eating a whole bag a day for a while cause they were so good. i am glad that they do not have any dextrose in them like lays do.
1	i &apos;ve tried over a dozen varieties of k-cups and this is , by far , my favorite ! it &apos;s strong but not bitter and just has a great flavor. this will be my choice from now on.
1	the thai coconut ginger noodles are quick and easy to prepare. you will be rewarded with delicious noodles to enjoy by yourself or share as a side dish with another noodle enjoyer.
0	our dog enjoyed this for 10 minutes and the bottom broke. the part that screws in the bottom cracked. i &apos;m very disappointed.
1	i agree with the company motto &quot; a natural obsession &quot; . i tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent. the flavor of these is very strong , so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor , like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread. otherwise they compete or clash with the other food.
1	it makes good tasting gluten free food ... but ... like most gluten free food , it &apos;s expensive and it &apos;s got a slight grit to it. i &apos;ve made biscuits , waffles , and pancakes with it ... a friend made some awesome banana bread with it. it &apos;s very good for gluten free ...
1	these are the best chips ever. i will buy them again , wish more stores had them.the plain chips are my fav.
0	this was not a hit ! it &apos;s bitter , like maybe the carrots were not sweet and / or not peeled ? and the main ingredient is carrots ! ( amazon should include the ingredients for all items ) quality control seems to be an issue. this is the second &quot; gourmet meal &quot; flavor with this issue. i had never had a bad experience with the eb products before , very disappointing.
1	i love geliva coffee.its not bitter like some of the brands and it set well on my stomach.i have too say its the best coffee i every had and i tried a lot of expensive brands as well as the lesser expensive this is mid price and i love it.i will continue to buy this frm amazon every three months
1	this is the best quality chamomile tea i have ever tried ! this is only 1 oz. so it &apos;s a little pricey , but i will buy it again anyway , because the quality is out of this world. you will get three nice cups of tea out of one tablespoon , but the first one is the best , of course. i like mine strong. chamomile fans will love this tea.
1	but a naturapath told me to take this , vitamin d , vitamin c , and something he mixed and i got better from a 8-month sinus issue.
1	this is the buy of a lifetime. $ 25 for about 50 beans instead of $ 10 for 2 ! and the flavor was great. made ice cream that everyone raved about. i vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
1	i have been using the product for several months now. the dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice. what more can i say ?
0	i have no idea how old are these , maybe were not stored properly , rancid smell in some of them. unevenly chopped , between dust and quarter hazelnuts you have all the sizes evenly distributed. what kind of recipe uses such things ?
0	several broke during transit causing mold to grow over all the other jars. jars are cheaper at walmart.
0	wow , very weird taste. i typically like all the ingredients , but this mix just tastes wrong. it &apos;s somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea , but with a licorice aftertaste. it isn &apos;t so bad that i couldn &apos;t finish the first cup , but not my cup of tea.
1	possibly the best salt and vinegar chips ( healthy or not ) ever ! the salt is just right and compliment the vinegar &apos;s tartness perfectly. all the chips are good .. salt and pepper can be a little overwhelming.
0	i have tried quite a few k-cup products and this one left me longing for something else. it kind of has a burnt taste to it. i have tried newman &apos;s coffee via a mcdonald &apos;s and it did not taste like this. overall i was disappointed and have moved on to the likes of wolfgang puck. these tend to be a little more smooth.
1	the southern mills gravy is a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes. the mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. it hits the table and it is gone .... everyone seems to love it.
1	if you like garlic this is for you. i &apos;ve been making this as a dip with greek yogurt and reduced fat mayonnaise. i usually add chopped spinach to it and serve it with crudites and chips. i have gotten rave reviews from my friends. my only complaint is that it consists of dried vegetables and a powder and it is difficult to make sure they are equally distributed when measuring it out.
0	gimme better ingredients ( kind / larabars ) for more $ or sweeter items ( genuine junk ) for less $ . not sure i &apos;d invest in a single bar again , let alone this size.
1	these were great - just as described. used them for a bee-themed party , and now we use them as &quot; to go &quot; packs of honey for our coffee and tea.
0	if you go to your local walmart you can buy an 80 count in a pouch for 2.88 so you can get 240 pieces for 8.72 , its also at target and probably at most stores.
1	whole family likes these. tasty but not over sweet. much more healthy for you than most bars. excellentprice through amazon on the repeating order subscription.
1	never had jerky before because i &apos;ve never seen a halal version. was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive. went through a whole bag in one sitting. i recommend all my curious muslim brothers and sisters to try it.
1	i just picked these up at random at my local asian market , and i am really impressed. i &apos;d drive the 15-20 minutes there again just to pick these up. they have an excellent coffee flavor and aren &apos;t horribly sweet like most hard candies. each candy is individually wrapped and lasts a good long time.
1	our daughter was very unhappy because she could not find chi-chi &apos;s sweet corn cake mix in her grocery stores. thanks to amazon.com the &quot; fix &quot; was easy. we had corn cake while dining on lake powell. heard the grand kids were enjoying more chi-chi &apos;s corn cake last night. thank you ! sr
0	carbquik is an amazing product. i use it for all kinds of bread like things on my low carb diet. breadsticks are delicious , the pizza crust is awesome. my only gripe with this is that its twice the price on amazon. netrition.com offers it for nearly half the price.
1	mae ploy sweet chili sauce is the best. i use it instead of duck sauce. check it out. once you try it , you &apos;ll be hooked.
0	i ordered and got seeds. called , got a refund and reordered ... got seeds. i &apos;ll have to order the sprouted chia seed powder elsewhere. : )
0	i bought a couple of flavors from halo &apos;s , both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. my cats would not touch it.
1	i recently received a kuerig coffee maker and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product. disposacups came to the resue. these durable cups can be filled with your own coffee rather than the expensive kuerig cups. my only issue with these cups is that when i fill them to save for later use , the tops do not stay on snuggly. hope they work on this.
0	if anyone knows of one that does not have it , please let me know ! it definitely isn &apos;t very strong , but i coulod handle it if it didn &apos;t have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.this has artificial sweetener ( sucorse ) just like the other hot chocolates out there.
0	so we cancelled the order. it was cancelled without any problem. that is a positive note ...
0	first of all , the tea is gross. it tastes nothing like bubble milk tea. secondly , the seller must know this product is less than expected because they sell it in incriments of two ( 2.2lb ) bags. now im stuck with two bags ( 4.4lbs ) of this junk. i want my 30 bucks back.
1	nice amount of heat and smoke. very tasty chip that goes great with a brew.
1	the switch orange-tangerine beverage is a mix of orange and tangerine juices with carbonated water , and , i must say , it tastes amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! it &apos;s similar to soda , but without all the unhealthy artificial ingredients and high-fructose corn syrup. if you find it , buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	trader joe &apos;s pomegranate white tea is superior to this tea. this is very bitter and perfumey. maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . i found it repulsive.
1	this is a great product , we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. we will purchase this product again. amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage.
1	this tastes great and i like that it &apos;s more natural than most other sodas available. basically , it &apos;s a carbonated juice. i generally prefer a larger 12 oz. size though.
1	these are such a treat when you are craving that salty , crunchy snack. and the multi-box where you get a variety of flavors is perfect. share it with son so they don &apos;t get stale but not much chance of that. one of my &quot; 3 points plus &quot; weight watchers snacks that i don &apos;t run out of !
0	i like some of coffee bean direct coffees , but i cannot stand the taste of this one , and no one else in the house likes it either. i wish i could of bought it in a smaller package , rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over $ 30. i do not recommend this product to anyone , but everybody has their own taste , and some people may like it.
0	i tried this product solely for the fact it has wolfgang &apos;s name on it. i should have stuck with timothy &apos;s brand. this was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee , more like a dinner coffee. i will not be buying this again , also way too expensive compared to the others.
0	the shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent. all other items in this order were excellent. these were lollipops shaped and &quot; painted &quot; like flamingos. but you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are ! they &apos;ll be &quot; ok &quot; to set out on the candy buffet , but they won &apos;t be the eye-catching item we &apos;d anticipated when we ordered.
1	this is good iced tea. it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter.
0	i find it curious that you can not find this k-cup on van houtte &apos;s website. you can find the raspberry chocolate truffle light but not this specific k-cup. given some of the very negative reviews of this product , perhaps it is a discontinued item or maybe it is not a van houtte product.
1	i haven &apos;t had a chande to actually try the k-cups to see if they work as advertised. however the order arrived on time and in excellent condition. for this a gave the 4 star rating. if the cups work as advertised , then this rating will jump to 5 stars.
0	plese , could you please contact with ups and ask if they let my package in my adddres , please are my christmas present
1	this is an excellent candy for those of us who have to limit our chocolate intake. each bar is sectioned into six pieces , which helps with portion control--and makes it perfect for sharing ! my only quibble is that it &apos;s sometimes hard to get all the waxed paper off the candy , as it &apos;s quite sticky.
1	heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. had one while traveling and loved it ! ! ! i sat on the plane enjoying it ... i was thinking , i should bought another one !
1	i don &apos;t know if it has changed since then , but when i lived in australia 14 years ago , one thing that stood out to me was how real drinks tasted compared to the artificial flavors typical of america. switch brought me back to those days. it starts out tangy and the taste turns sweeter in my mouth. if they knocked 50 calories off , i would definitely purchase this regularly.
1	this tea was a gift. we are down to the last two tea bags , and i had been unable to find it. alas , it was on the find anything site-amazon. this particular herbal blend doesn &apos;t sound particularly appealing , but one taste and you will be hooked. a smooth , complex blend. just lovely.
0	i ordered a box of the omaha steaks top sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. toughest meat i &apos;ve ever had. there was absolutely no flavor to the steak and i didn &apos;t want to waste it so i gave it to my dogs
1	i received a box of this for christmas. it is really good. not overly strong like most black licorice. it is indeed soft and it has a very simple ingredient list with no high fructose corn syrup like most candy : molasses wheat flour licorice extract natural flavor ( aniseed oil )
1	these are one of my favorite flavors of tic tacs. the flavor is a true sour cherry and quite intense. you really get a lot of flavor out of one 2-calorie treat , which can satisfy for quite a while !
1	these chips are the only ones i found to be tasty and healthy. they have fewer fat calories plus higher fiber for those who want good taste and nutrition--the perfect blend !
1	i &apos;m glad my 45lb cocker / standard poodle puppy loves the stuff because i trust the brand and its superior nutrition. compare labels ! my previous feed ( pedigree ) was mostly corn. my little dude is healthy and happy and high energy and has a glossy coat. also , superior nutrition produces smaller , compact stools.
1	the chips are delicious ! ! i absolutely love them. they are very addicting. excellent for people with gluten / wheat allergies. the only thing was that during the shipping process the chips became broken and crumbled , not as bad as i thought after reading other reviews but still quite a few crumbs in the bottom of the bags. i would order again.
0	i really like the taste of this coffee ! my only complaint is that the coffee grinds end up in my coffee. not a huge fan of that and even though i really like the taste of it i will not order again , bummer ! ! = (
0	wow ! is there anyone actually buying this from this source anymore ? the price is double what it used to be and locally i buy it for 4.29.
1	i bought this product for a friend , but i liked it so much , i &apos;m keeping it and buying a second one for my friend !
1	have used this herbal tea for sometime now ... one cup before bedtime and it always helps me rest better. love the discount for ordering the six months supply.
1	have you ever try bbq chicken wings ? use this glase and it would be delicious. i used it a lot but usually bought it in super market. today i didn &apos;t find it there so i came online and order more here price is much better here.
1	the stuff is great but i &apos;ll pay at most $ 4 or $ 5 for four bottles.
1	a nice case of chips that are quite tasty. i definitely enjoy the kettle sea salt and black pepper. i just wish they were bigger bags : )
1	i am now on my last box ( of three ) of this gevalia espresso roast and have been impressed. it does pack a punch like the other reviewer said. one double shot latte of this made in my aeropress at 9pm keeps me up until a good 2am in the morning. ; )
0	the kettle chip itself is crisp , crunchy and good , although somewhat greasy. over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with rosemary flavoring. leaves greasy , gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips.
0	like many others have said , gnats ! it would be a fine product except for that. used some insecticidal soap , so far so good. caveat emptor !
1	great tasting coffiee ! ! one of the best i &apos;ve ever had ! the problem here is the high shipping costs.
0	the cups came in a brown paper bag that was crumbled like it had been used several times. the receipt i got said 24 k-cups and this site said 22 k-cups. disappointed. i purchased this for a gift and it looks horrible to get as a gift.
1	kids love the sauce on many things ... great on rice , chicken , spicy &amp; sweet. highly recommend.
0	this little mat has little points that stick out of it. my cat does not like to step on it and has begun to try and jump out of his box , causing litter to be spread everywhere. do yourself and your cat a favor and do not buy this.
1	the bananas are a little runnier than most brands , but overall , my son loves this stuff. and what a great price !
0	i was really hoping this would be good. unfortunately it is not. overall , the nutritional composition of peanuts is extremely good , with most of the peanut &apos;s fat being monounsaturated. they also provide an excellent source of protein , vitamin e , and fiber. so make your own peanut butter , or just buy the natural with no additives.
0	item came promptly however the crisps were 3 months past their freshness date. was told i would get replacements. still waiting.
1	wow ... it &apos;s delicious ! the kids love it ! we made it for breakfast this morning ... the pancakes were eaten in no time at all ! the only complaint was that there wasn &apos;t more ! ( actually , it was disappointing that the boxes weren &apos;t bigger )
1	just wanted to compliment this company on their great , prompt service and the freshness of the cookies .. bought them to give as a gift , and when i brought them home my kids ate them lol. i would recommend these cookies to anyone and everyone ..
0	don &apos;t bother getting these. you &apos;ll spend more time cleaning up the mess due to the poor packaging then you &apos;ll spend enjoying them.
0	i have a waring pro popcorn maker. this is like a minature movie type popcorn maker. i purchase this great n popcorn 4 oz packs. when used 1 / 4 of corn kernels of packets don &apos;t pop. i tried longer times , still the same result.
1	these eggs are soo good i think im addicted they are so yummy and i cant eat just one i was very satisfied with this product and it was shipped to me so quick said it would take a week only took 3 days ! ! ! im very pleased and will always buy my goodies from this seller.
1	this is the moistest , most delicious cake in the world. if you like almond tarts , marzipan , that kind of taste , you will be in love with this cake. normally i think packaged cake is awful , by the way. this one is amazing.
1	these tic tacs are great right up there with the orange flavor. i did find them cheaper at the 99cent store 49cents a pack. i went recently and bought 24 for $ 12 heads up for anyone living in ca.
1	snappy white popcorn is excellent. it pops up nicely , and has a great texture. it is extremely fresh. as for taste it is 100 times better than the store brands. ( imo ) give it a try.
0	very loud. we have a larg dog that likes to counter surf and is always hungry. thought this would be good for prolonging his mealtime and making it challenging for him. even though i put small dog food in , it was extremely difficult to get the food out. he gave up after about 5 minutes. was disappointed in product.
1	the strawberry twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. six pounds will be around for a while with my son and i.
1	they taste great and are healthy. we keep our home stocked with nana &apos;s cookie bars.
0	this jar of light coral goo is filed in the back of the fridge with &quot; one-recipe &quot; stuff and other exotica. it is waiting there for me to admit that my curiosity and desire for novelty beat back my better judgement. in a blind-tasting , &quot; bacon &quot; would not be my first reaction and the texture is slimy and unappealing ( room temp or cold ) .
1	it was shipped in a very nice package and i have no complain with the seller. my plant growing bigger and now i am looking for a bigger pot to transplant. it &apos;s good .... if you are looking for a a workspace plant that needs minimal maintenance this is the plant you might need.
1	pops great in the microwave. much better than many store brands. good product.
1	my father-in-law bought some for me to try. love it ! very sweet. no aftertaste. wonderful all-natural sweetener. my new choice , replacing all those other artificial packets i used to use.
1	it is great thin and tasty brown rice. just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect. thank you.
1	i just made some in my whirley pop. it really is lighter and crisper than the larger , yellow kernels. none of those large hulls either. the only difference is , it pops up much smaller than the yellow , so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot. lovely homemade popcorn.
0	this stuff is the most vile , disgusting stuff i &apos;ve ever tried. it &apos;s so wrong on so many levels. the texture is odd , the taste is odd , and nothing could salvage it. sick sick sick ! ! !
1	i found these chips originally at a local market. however , i have been unable to find them since. whew ! what a relief when i was able to locate them. these chips have so much flavor , they &apos;re not greasy and they are crunchy. i am a chip-a-holic and these are by far the best chips i have ever eaten.
0	this company is a sponsor of the rush limbaugh radio show. this means that proflowers pays for and profits from mr. limbaugh &apos;s hate speechs against women and non-caucasian people.
1	many food establishments serve chna mista tea and i love the flavor , i was happy to be able to purchase it on amazon. i make it my iced tea maker it &apos;s so easy and has a great taste with less caffeine. try it you will love it too.
1	kavli crispy thin crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses. the taste is fantastic. it &apos;s fresh and pleasant to eat. kavli products are the best.
1	you could find this in local supermarkets about 4 months ago but now it nowhere to be found. every time kellogg &apos;s makes a great cereal , they quit making it soon after. this is the case with just right , that was the best stuff on the planet !
0	we have been giving our 100 pound shepherd / lab / collie / husky mix hip action since he was a pup. our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd &apos;s usually have. eventhough i cannot buy it locally , i make sure to buy it on line so my boy will remain healthy and happy !
1	i &apos;ve tried pretty much every pepper covered peanut ( or cashew ) on the market and these are by far the best. you &apos;d better like spicy though.
1	i found wild thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products - the lemon salad refresher is my favorite salad dressing , it is light , now cal , and very tasty. excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. yum ! their customer service is excellent and helpful , and the site shares some great recipes as well. i &apos;m a fan.
1	i think this is a really good deal. i seal it up in a rubbermaid container and just scoop it out to brew. good stuff !
1	simply wonderful ! it adds that last little bit of wow to your cake creations. i will be back for more !
0	i don &apos;t believe these are real strawberries. i think this product is made from strawberry pulp + sugar + who knows what. they seem like slightly more healthy strawberry gummy bears candy.
1	the beans arrived in good time , moist and supple , no mold , very good flavor. what else is there to want in regular bourbon vanilla beans ? i was very pleased with this purchase.
1	surprisingly tasty. thin and crip. very cracker like and good for snacking. i got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. these are great for when we travel. it isn &apos;t easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good , but these work quite well.
0	this coffee was substituted for a coffee i had ordered in a coffee club. it was $ 4.00 more than what i usually get and like. it was bitter ( harsh ) and strong. i thought it was terrible. quit the coffee club and would not order this again.
1	this is a very tasty cacao powder. it arrived in an unmarked bag ( does not have an organic symbol or product description ) but it seems to be the real deal. good flavor , similar to or better than name brand powders i have purchased in the past. will definitely purchase again.
1	i ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days ( 3 ) . the tea is excellent and the price was right for me.
1	these are not only a good value ( health food stores really jack up the prices on rice cakes ! ) but also are nicely thin and easy to use to spread stuff on.
0	gross ! i tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes. the flavor is all fake sweetener ( odd since sucralose is the last ingredient ) and no dark chocolate. i am bummed because now i have a box of these cups and don &apos;t want to drink them.
1	these cookies are both yummy and well priced. i recommend them. other cookies i like are mrs. fields ( packaged ) , chips ahoy soft baked , fig newtons , oreos , and elf cookies.
0	the bees were perfect , however there were only 12 on each card as opposed to the 16 advertised - this left us quite short on our project : (
1	amazon has the best price in town. hot nuts that don &apos;t disappoint. i would recommend trying dave &apos;s other items as well. great flavor.
0	long story short. creamers thrown into single box , no protection. opened box and there was liquid creamer all over the contents. think twice before oredering or subscribing.
1	i &apos;ve sampled many different k-cup coffe types. i prefer a really robust coffee and carbou mahogany really dosn &apos;t provide that. i would cassify it as medium roast coffee with a smooth melow taste. if that is what u are after , then give this blend a try.
1	caribou &apos;s mahogany is my favorite k-cup coffee. it &apos;s got a great , rich taste. it &apos;s dark , but not bitter.
1	i have 3 cats ... 2 could care less .. the other one loves this so much. i have it by their food bowls and she nibbles on it every day. no throwing up like outside grass.
1	our friends from germany visited with us a few weeks back , and one of them adores manhattans. she had them here 15 years back , and when i no longer could find a bottled mix locally , i ordered it from the internet. this is my first experience with master of mixes , and the manhattans turned out great , just as good as if i had made them from scratch. a great product !
0	i searched for unsweetened cranberries on the amazon website. these come up. the bag is folded a bit in your picture so the &quot; sweetened with apple concentrate &quot; is not clear. this food is loaded with sugar. i &apos;ll give them away , since i can &apos;t return them. you need to fix the search on this product so it does not come up as &quot; unsweetened cranberries. &quot;
1	brought this product for recording a radio program from home. along with the behringer c-1 microphone , provides a cost effective solution.
1	we can &apos;t have any kind of coffee maker at work , so we &apos;re forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or starbuck &apos;s across the street. in this economy , no one wants to pay those high prices , so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh , hot , tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks folgers ! ! !
1	i love this coffee , its dark but not bitter and smooth as silk. its a big cup size 12oz so its great in the morning when i don &apos;t want to get up for coffee too much. if you have a tassimo you should have this coffee blend on hand !
0	be careful when odering this , because they say it &apos;s a 6 pk , but you will only get a 4 pk , plus the formula goes out in 4 months. so if you did like i did and got it early for grandchildren your out of luck ! so i know i will not be buying off of this site again for food for my grandchildren , because they won &apos;t be able to eat it.
1	i love it ! it &apos;s strong enough to start at least 10 gallons of wine , yet light enough to be flexible , very important for pushing the lid down inside for a sanitizing solution. future models should come with calibrations so you know how much liquid is inside but that was easy to overcome with a sharpie and a measuring container.
1	i &apos;m so addicted to these ! ! ! you know the movie when harry met sally ? when i drink one of these it just feels like that famous scene in the movie ... orgasmic !
1	i absolutly love these candies that are only put on the market at christmas and valentine &apos;s day. i would buy them all year if they were available : so you can imagine how excited i was tao be able to get them for a while through amazon.i can wait untill christmas when they will be available again.
0	these condiments are overpriced and terrible. the classic is disgustingly sweet. the spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.
1	this taffy is so good. it is very soft and chewy. the flavors are amazing. i would definitely recommend you buying it. very satisfying ! !
1	this coffee has a good flavor and a good strength. at first it seemed strong but then i got use to it. i recommend this flavor coffee. good wake up in the morning.
1	great formula , our son is not getting stomach pains like with the regular similac and he actually likes the taste. the only thing is that it &apos;s way cheaper at costco ( $ 27.82 per 34oz + tax ) . amazon is not willing to price match ! ! !
1	what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use. this box should last our family the year no problem. iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
0	another great idea for a dog toy , but my medium-sized dog cracked the yellow covers in less than 5 min. the plastic shattered. she will never see those little yellow covers again. i might find a way to cover the food wells with something else , now that i &apos;m stuck with this toy. my dog is not a chewer , and this toy did not stand up.
1	it worked just as it claimed. i had no leaking at all and it brewed a really great tasting cup of coffee. really happy that i &apos;ve found these.
1	this jerky is extremely addictive ! i have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky i have ever had. it was originally king b jerky.
1	sooo good , i followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box. sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some mae ploy chili sauce on it with some lime juice too , made a nice salad with a kick ! also very good with cilantro and daikon.
1	i &apos;m really picky about the gum i chew. this is great and the flavor lasts a long time. i recommend it.
1	i haven &apos;t seen these on the shelf for a while now so decided to buy here , although 12 boxes is a lot. they &apos;re great with butter and honey. haven &apos;t tried them with anything else. they &apos;re very thin and fragile and so whatever you put on them will stand out. but they still have a healthy taste.
1	you won &apos;t miss your old waffle / pancake mix when using this wonderful product. i mix it with oatmeal in most cases and it makes wonderful waffles. pretty easy to give up gluten with this mix.
0	the &quot; rope &quot; idea doesn &apos;t really work ( well it works 1 time ) . it actually impedes the dispensing of the treats after your dog yanks it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human pushes the rope back in. would not purchase again !
1	this tea is full of flavor without bitterness. no additions needed. you will not be disappointed. do not try this earl grey if you do not like bergamot.
1	this is the mother load of canned clams. not just a can of juice with a few floaters , but cups and cups of chopped clams. i found no sand residuals , and i was able to use every last drop of juices.simply devine recipe on the can , best white clam sauce i &apos;ve ever made ...
1	great. not like other decaf , which seems to hav a weird taste to me. if you keep trialing different decafs to find one you like , definitely give this a try.
1	this gluten free &amp; milk free product is awesome ! i am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk. it is great to have such a delicious &amp; easy breakfast that doesn &apos;t make my stomach hurt !
0	i find the texture of this , and most other brown rice pastas , to be really off-putting. there are much better alternative-grain pastas available , like quinoa.
1	this is one of my wife &apos;s favorite. grove square has another great product to share with kcup users. now we need some specials to bring the price per unit down.
1	i find many k-cups are weak and not what i am used to ( starbucks ) , but this french roast is a pretty good subsitute to the $ 2 coffee i get from the store.
1	oh man , i love this candy ! it &apos;s super delicious , but its really not that sour. i &apos;d always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each ! = )
1	i love this brand ( i ordered 1st via amazon ) . great , fluffy corn , with very few un-popped kernels in my hot air popper. didn &apos;t try the old-fashioned fry-pan method , but expect similar results. definitely will buy again when needed.
1	this lands in the gormet category for sure. having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home. the price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that. they cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.
0	after seeing this on oprah i thought i would be good. i was not impressed as it has too much smoke flavoring in it , which takes away from the bacon flavor. sorry that it came in a 3 jar pack ; however , i definitely won &apos;t buy it again.
1	we live an hour away from any stores that would carry this product so it &apos;s easier and cheaper than making the trip.
1	we love the earth &apos;s best line in our house. our 9 mo old daughter will only eat earth &apos;s best dinners , and i don &apos;t blame her. the smell from both of the other 2 brand was nauseating. i &apos;ve sampled the earth &apos;s best dinners myself , and they aren &apos;t half bad ... it is baby food .... the fruit blends and veggie blends are great as well.
0	the eggnog was not eggnog - they should try another name , as this is misleading. the cartons are really difficult to open - i use a screwdriver.
1	neither myself nor my husband can have any type of corn products , but we love cornbread. this mix makes biscuits that taste just like corn bread to us. nice to find an alternative that tastes so great ! appreciate having this order size option as well since it &apos;s often missing from grocery store shelves.
0	product was delivered on time and free of charge. the seeds , however , did not germinate. i tried them in different soil placing them in a different location and they still did not germinate. i would not purchase seeds from this supplier again.
1	these are the best chips out there .. nothing can beat this taste. if you like honey mustard then you will definitely like this .. once you eat it you wont stop .. addicting stuff
1	both of our dogs are fed bil-jac. my older dog , dixie , loves this senior version. it &apos;s nutritionally dense , with meat as it &apos;s primary ingredient and without empty fillers and fats. dixie &apos;s weight is easier to maintain with this formula , and she has the most marvelous shiny coat too.
0	coffee was good but every cup broke during use , making a mess inside the cup and out , will not purchase again.
1	it was this or a big tub of spice drops. these are better for diabetics. they didn &apos;t last long , and my wife enjoys the mess i make &apos; round the la-z-boy.
1	i have a cafe in talent , oregon. i couldnt find this product wholesale anywhere. this is so convienient and free shipping and it was here in just a few days ! ! my supplier could only get small amounts of inferior product and it would take 3 weeks. thanks amazon !
0	i am one of those people who like sweet lemon chicken. this is not sweet. it is not spicy , either. the yellow dye is very excessive and your fingers can stain if you touch the sauce. if you want to try it out , i &apos;d recommend buying one packet if you can.
1	i am very pleased with this selection. i have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for keurig but this one is awesome ! i bought the milk chocolate.
1	patak &apos;s makes the best curry around. i frequently use it in my yellow chicken curry dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old.
0	$ 5.00 over the local grocer &apos;s regular price. i expected a fair market price when i placed this order , but because i didn &apos;t research it i was extremely disappointed to find it so inflated. live and learn , i hope i can save someone else the trouble of having to make a return.
0	lacks the flavor i was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level. i won &apos;t be ordering this again. live and learn.
0	i like fruity but not with a weird mint taste. hated it and am trying to give it away but no one likes the weird fruity mint either. no wonder it &apos;s been a manager &apos;s special for so long. : (
1	this product is positively wonderful ! use it anywhere you might use ordinary balsamic , but use it sparingly as it packs a very fruity punch. apply just a bit to some fresh berries and pour it over vanilla ice cream for a fantastic desert treat.
1	nothing easier. nothing better. even beats grandmother &apos;s white gravy recipe. already peppered for you. you do nothing but mix it with water. takes only a minute or two. i highly recommend this gravy mix. it will not disappoint.
1	my neighbor and i love this candy and it &apos;s difficult to find the 1.7 oz. packets in the stores. so i just decided to purchase a whole case. they were fresh and great tasting.
0	i did not realize when i decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that i found them stale and hard. i had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh. sorry that i could not give these a better review.
1	great product ! the stevia powder will not raise your blood glucose level and it is all natural. use very sparingly since it is much sweeter than sugar. tastes more natural than artifical sweeteners and is healthy to use since it is an organic natural sweetener.
1	i got two bags from my friend who got it from his friend who said it was primo. so i chucked them in a zip-lock when i got home. 3 mos. later i opened it and had some today. i am online trying to find more.
0	i received these in bad condition. most of them were broken , but the ones that weren &apos;t had holes in them. they were so weak that they would tear when you tried to roll them. i would try three ladies brand. they are a way higher quality.
0	this listing is for nestle cerelac mixed vegetables and rice with milk , but the item shipped are nestle cerelac mixed fruits and wheats with milk. happened several times , and still totally wrong item sent. not recommended to buy !
1	it isn &apos;t healthy , despite the description above , though i did not buy it for that reason. i love pasta , but for my uses preparing a fresh batch , then adding the sauce would be both expensive , and time consuming. this is the best solution. i will buy this variety again in the future , in the can version , for more days.
0	i adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition. she &apos;s skinny and will eat very little besides wiskas. i think it &apos;s soilent green for cats. i would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else. i don &apos;t think she &apos;s long for this world ! !
1	i purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend. this works well for that , however , i did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free. both options worked well in the cookies.
0	this is seriously the only food we have purchased that my baby rejected ever. she has eaten everything we &apos;ve given her. poor thing gagged and gagged every spoon i tried ...
1	this is a very versital product ! ! ! ! love it. my husband must eat gluten free and my kids prefer pancakes made with this !
0	i have been told by my veternarian that glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so i wanted to return 3 unopened packages ( of 3 each ) and the company will not accept returns. ridiculous. they must know how bad they are for animals.
0	i love haribo gold bears and the rolls of the disks , but the consistency of the haribo gummi pink grapefruit is very strange. it is similar to the sugared sliced fruit , but with hard pieces throughout. some people love the sliced fruit candies , my husband does , but not me. hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste.
0	when i got this it was melted through the package and what wasn &apos;t completely destroyed was stuck to the inside of the wrappers. you would think that if you are going to ship chocolate in the summer time you would pack it in something cold. i wasn &apos;t very happy with it. i love the candy and once you peeled it off the insides of the wrappers it was good.
0	the chicken is not organic. it is the main ingredient. this is not organic dog food. it is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
1	the lobster bisque is absolutely delicious. nice lobster flavor ; i cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. just open , heat and enjoy. i &apos;ve become such a fan of the baxter &apos;s line that i can &apos;t wait to try them all.
1	my first package came damaged but the first rate customer service department replaced it quickly. the orzo are delicious and easy to cook.
1	i prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one. they &apos;re usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips. if you like old-school jerky then i highly recommend this product. delicious !
0	i have purchased these in the past , but this order tasted a little stale. i have purchased food many times , but this was the first time that i have been disappointed in the quality. i should have returned it.
1	this water is delicious. i &apos;m not picky , but i can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. and at 50 cents per bottle , delivered to your door , it &apos;s a great price. i have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it &apos;s a-okay with me. better than drinking a coke.
0	these look like noodles , but after that there is no comparing this product to pasta. the texture is rubbery and there is no flavor. if you love pasta , you will not love this product.
1	now , we &apos;re not big juice drinkers in this family. we take apple juice or cherry juice and mix it with unflavored seltzer water because otherwise we find it too sweet. this is the same. it &apos;s nicely carbonated , and it has a pretty authentic fruit taste , but it &apos;s still too sickly sweet. cut it half and half with unflavored seltzer and a little ice and you &apos;ll be happy.
1	i am very happy i switched from a very popular dog food , sold in a lot of vets offices to newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress. all has been well with my fur baby ever since ; - ) and to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than i can get it at the local store , how can you beat that ?
1	if you like shortbread you will really like these. walkers always makes the best shortbread. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001gcvlxg &quot; &gt; walkers shortbread highlander shortbread portion pack , 1.4 ounce units ( pack of 24 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	these are really good tasting chips , they aren &apos;t too unhealthy so you can eat a fair amount. love the flavoring.
1	i grew up in ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. i would dig tender roots or &quot; bark &quot; a few trees for a delightful tea. i purchased breezy morning sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product. not a good bargain. i switched to pappy &apos;s extract.
1	my family and i all agree that hodgson mill potato bread is one of the best mixes on the market. a loaf of this bread lasts about two hours before it is gone. it has become a favorite of ours , and we will be making lots. don &apos;t run out of this one !
1	these will last a long time the way we use them but could not pass up the deal .. came sealed and you could still smell the vanilla ... stick one or 2 in your favorite vodka and wait a few weeks ... we also make our own extract from them.
1	i love these things. unlike other products , this actually tastes really good. i would recommend this to my family and friends.
1	love the products , both the sugar free and the regular are great. feel refreshed , absolutely no crash. no after taste. stopped drinking monster and full throttle and started drinking exclusive !
1	my baby loves this. it &apos;s a great first food to start with when teaching your baby to have solids. the pouch makes it easy to get the product out , without making a mess and the lid is easy to refasten , so you can use it again over a few feeds.
1	i have to eat gluten free , but my family doesn &apos;t. this is the only pasta so far that my kids can &apos;t see a real difference. they like it a lot. this is one i fix when i don &apos;t have time or energy to fix separate things for them and myself. because it tastes yummy for all of us.
1	i keep a box of these in my desk at work. they make a wonderful snack or are great if i didn &apos;t have time for breakfast.
1	yum , i am so happy my mom bought this delicious and nutritious cat grass for me ! it helps me digest my food , and is just fun to poke around in when i &apos;m bored. and i notice that mom eats it too ( when she thinks i &apos;m not looking ! ) because it is so tasty !
0	this product says that it contains kava kava to help with it &apos;s calm tea , but there is no kava in it. this is confirmed by the tea box set as well as yogi tea website. i just thought i would make anyone else aware in case they were looking for a little supplemental kava for their tea , but don &apos;t want the other yogi tea with kava in it.
0	i purchased this after watching a vegetarian recipe on youtube. i added it to my chilean sea bass. big mistake ! this almost ruined my buttery , expensive fish. perhaps it works well on meat.
0	last month i paid $ 12 for 6 on subscribe and save , and now it is $ 25 ! what ? ? ? ? guess you don &apos;t want my business
1	great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them. extremely dry and hard.
1	i bought these when on sale through amazon. nice crispy thick chips. definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
1	i think bjs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by gerber , but if your child really loves peaches , this is great !
1	my daughter loves this ! she is picky so she doesn &apos;t always eat as many healthy foods as she should. this flavor gives her the vegetables and protein that she needs. it is a little bit grainier than other stage 2 foods but still very usable for babies over 6 months.
1	so glad to have found this tea ... it &apos;s my absolute holiday favorite ! thanks for the fast shipping too !
1	the packaging is so cute on all of ashby &apos;s teas and the tea is exceptional. i would recommend this tea to anyone.
0	i &apos;ve tried it with both my cats , several times. every time they eat this , and other whiskas temptations products , they vomit within minutes. they love it , they want it , it &apos;s cheap but it makes them puke , so , i &apos;d consider this a bad purchase.
1	wonderfully cinnamon-y ! i will definitely be ordering it again ! and heated up with a tiny bit of butter on it put it over the top in taste.
1	i used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. they came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. they do come in a group of 16 ... such a great value ! i was extremely satisfied !
0	this candy when i opened the chocolate had white spots and looked like thick chalk. i later noticed that the box had a snow flake pattern like it was sold around xmas time. no good !
1	these are really good ! i find grandpa po &apos;s originals to be filling and delicious , and since they &apos;re technically whole grain , they are way better to have in the house than doritos.
0	the tea is fine , but you must be very , very careful to avoid having the tea bag rip apart when you take the tag off the tea bag. i have repeatedly ruined tea bags just by trying to get the tag off.
1	licorice freakin rocks man , i like to take the licorice ropes and choke my self till im blue , then chew my way out. man this stuff is like crack , i just want roll it up and smoke it like a big fatty.
0	i &apos;m really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it &apos;s not even the same product that we used to love. a couple of years ago , the product was consistently fantastic , but now the taste , quality of the meat , and freshness are hit or miss ... and recently it &apos;s all been a miss.
1	great tasting tea - in fact , much better then the bags of same. i &apos;m an decaf irish breakfast tea drinker but can &apos;t find that in k-cups. english breakfast in k-cups tastes great ! !
1	life without bird &apos;s custard has been hell ! i &apos;ve tried other varieties-sthg from holland if i recall correctly-just not up to snuff ... i ordered 6 to ensure i never run out ! better than ice cream and not half as fattening.
0	these noodles are not made in thailand as the website , states , but in china ! i advised amazon of this , but they have yet to change the advertising , so buyer beware. if you prefer not to eat rice products from china , do not purchase these noodles.
0	nrver , never buy a food product that keeps its ingredients , calories and nutritional components a secret
0	this galil roasted chestnuts are undoubtedly the worse product i have ever ordered from amazon. i literally threw them away. not edible by me.
1	i went on a diet last year and was looking for something goos to drink and came across this tes ! now i can &apos;t find it anywhere ... hope amazon keeps this product forever !
0	when i bought this i was hoping it would be like peanut butter but almond flavor. its not close. i suppose if you can &apos;t eat peanuts this might be an alternative but i would look at other nut butters.
1	for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaska ! .. so i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them. they are very good chips ! amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing. i would order groceries online.
1	absolutely delicious have tried it on everything from meat and fish to scrambled eggs highly recommend it
0	smooth coffee with rich , flavorful aroma , along with &quot; low acid &quot; are some of the things i like about this coffee. but the actual taste and the after-taste aren &apos;t my cuppa joe.
0	the product was expired for a year before i received it. it was unusable , and i had to throw it away.
0	it seemed like it would be a good idea , but my dog could not get the treats out. she is tiny and the extra small was way too big for her. i like the iq ball way better.
1	these are probably the best crackers i &apos;ve ever tasted. they came in a christmas gift basket , but i liked them so much that i had to google them to see how to get more. this variety contains oregano , poppyseed , and garlic powder. because of how thin they are , there &apos;s nowhere for the flavor to hide ! try them with smoked provolone. i highly recommend them.
1	researched a lot on internet before buying these .. great price , great taste ... completly happy with my purchase ... although a bit expensive , but a quality product does comes with a price tag ! ! ! !
1	this coffee is delicious. it is full bodied and leaves a great almost chocolaty after taste. my dad told me about it after a trip to costa rica.
1	so far this is the only k-cup i &apos;ve found thats tastes great with a normal brew ! it &apos;s not watered down like the regular stuff , and dosen &apos;t taste burnt like the bold stuff. they only k-cup i &apos;m buying from now on !
1	we are chocolate moose &amp; mickey moose , our nice owner bought this great food for us. we love it very much , i have gained 5 lbs. because i eat all of mickey &apos;s food when he isn &apos;t looking ! our skin and fur is much better now too. : )
1	not so sure about this product. chicken and rice is not really what there is. sure there is some chicken and some rice but mostly gravy. all in all i still like it.
0	i have made potato bread before with great results but this hodgson bread-mix is way too dry , it needs some more moisture-don &apos;t buy it unless you want really dry bread.
1	these are the best chips i have ever eaten. everyone in our family loves them. sweet but spicy- crispy .... really good. delivery was perfect , no crushed chips. fantastic overall.
0	i &apos;m amazed that people are happy with this product. i &apos;m not a drinker of the dark brews , french roast or anything , but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee , this is completely tasteless. the initial scent is delicious , too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee.
1	my cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and natural balance and had loose motions. so i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great.
1	the best investment i &apos;ve ever made for ginger. it &apos;s unbelievable ! it &apos;s fibrous like the real ginger , has that spicy kick to it , but it &apos;s perfect with the sugar - calms it down. it &apos;s very worth the $ 40 for 5lbs of it ! i &apos;ll be getting more soon - i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies : )
0	i made pancakes and biscuits with this mix and found them to be mediocre at best. i really tried to like this product , but the taste is just so far off -- for me. i wanted a break from making things from scratch , but this just was not worth it.
0	this was terrible coffee wolfgang pucks jamaicamecrazy , i received a partial refund but felt i should have gotten a full refund as i can &apos;t drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. i would like a response to this.
0	every single one of my twelve cans were badly dented. this is a total waste of coins. don &apos;t buy this item ! ! ! !
1	if i drank more than one commuter cup in the morning i &apos;d probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two , but this espresso ( made in my stove-top espresso maker ) is delicious and ( almost ) worth getting out of bed for.
1	i love these cups. my husband and i like community coffee from back home unfortunately , no kkup in their line yet. these diapisables are perfect. they perform just as reliably as the standard k cups with the economy and convienance of your own bulk coffees.
1	these rice crackers are truly delicious w / cheese or peanut butter. also i can eat crackers w / o gluten. as i am allergic to wheat , eggs , gluten , and bannas. this is my favorite snack on sunday nights. they come promptly and save me money. thank you. j. wolf
0	i order these for my dog all the time , the last order i purchased , the snack were all smashed and in almost powder form instead of like little nuggets how they usually are. not very happy.
1	this is the best cornmeal. i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. also fried some oysters with this meal , it gave them a great texture and flovor.
0	i bought those chips after reading good reviews but i was very disappointed with the taste. it was nothing like what i expected ( granted that i expected good old kettle cooked potato chips ) . i bought the 6-flavor variety pack and there were many flavors i did not care for. it was worth trying them but i am not going to purchase them again in the future.
1	it is simple. these chips taste great and are a healthier alternative to other brands. way better than anything baked ! i highly recommend them !
1	gluten free foods tend to be extremely expensive when compared to &quot; regular &quot; foods. this licorice follows that trend. for the times when you &apos;d like to treat yourself , candy tree organic licorice is a tasty and safe treat for gluten intolerant people. amazon seems to have the best prices on it too.
0	my son loves pumpkin muffins. can &apos;t find any libby pumpkin in cincinnati , oh. tried this hoping it would be the same and it wasn &apos;t. too much water in can maybe. didn &apos;t taste the same and wouldn &apos;t even feed the rest to my dog. do not waste money.
1	this stuff rocks ! ! ! i &apos;ve had it at two different spas and i just love it. it &apos;s tart and really unusual. a real treat.
1	i &apos;ve never made gluten free items before and i got great reviews from customers for my gluten free coffee cake.
1	product is exactly as advertised. what a savings ! at least half the retail price. easy to store because of the individual packaging.
1	i recently found out that i am allergic to wheat and milk. as you can imagine , this severely limits my snacking options. my local grocery was clearancing all of their organic section , so i tried these. they are so good ! i love salted &amp; plain rice cakes ( did before my diet change too ) &amp; these add an extra punch of flavor and crunch ! yum !
1	if you need to cut down on sugar this is the way to go ! i love stevia in my iced tea and it &apos;s great on your cereal also. great stuff ! !
0	i appreciate the effort for going the healthy route , unfortunately this totally destroys the taste. i had the regular root beer by blue sky before , at least it was decent. while the taste of this is so bland that i don &apos;t know how to describe it , the only way to make it bearable is by adding a packet of splenda for every can.
0	it &apos;s not an amazing tea. it &apos;s an &quot; okay &quot; tea. i buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and i get same result. i look for saving money. will not repurchase.
1	i was actually very surprised that this tasted like the real deal. it &apos;s very sweet , very limey , and the first couple hundred chews you can taste the crust and a smidge of whip cream. after a few minutes , it still has flavor. after an hour : it still has flavor. i love it ! you also get the tangy effect of a lime. not as strong but very pleasurable.
1	we have used this for all types of baking , including cakes , biscuits , and cookies. it works great and is every bit as good as crisco. buy organic !
0	i bought this on the recommendation from someone that also had a siberian husky. all i can say is that their husky must be fairly old. my 6 mth old siberian husky is very active &amp; a heavy chewer. she figured out how to unscrew the bottom of the jug in one day-then proceeded to chew it to pieces.
1	my son loves earth &apos;s best baby food. he enjoys his vegetables as much as he does with his fruits. he has no problem digesting his food and never spits it up.
1	this is the best hot cocoa i have tried for the keurig .... rich , chocolate flavor ( i used the 6oz setting ) and it is not watery. if you like hot cocoa , and the convenience of a k-cup , this is the one to get !
1	not paying attention , i thought this product was simply vanilla extract when i purchased it , tried it in my coffee , and got a shock. yummy ! i had to go examine the bottle , and realized my yummy mistake. i wonder what glycerin is , what it &apos;s made of ... ? is it a fat ? at any rate , it is delicious !
1	salt and vinegar and bbq rock ! plain were ok .... didn &apos;t really care for cheddar. nice to start w / a variety pack to find the ones you prefer.
0	i &apos;m sorry i bought this brand. it leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.no wonder amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. stay away ! ! ! avoid ! ! ! !
1	this is amazing chocolate for most baking. manjari in general is wonderful , fruity and deep in taste. but the feves in the 3 kg package melt super easily , the package is resealable and you can keep it in the fridge.
0	i bought this for my 8-mo-old blue heeler / husky puppy , and she managed to pull the rope enough to break it within 2 days. she &apos;s a rough-and-tumbler to be sure , but they claimed it was indestructible. hardly. pity too , she &apos;d almost learned how to use it.
0	i got these for my dad from his wish list. he thought they would be spicy and flavorful but they just tasted like cumin and had a funky smell. the box came with 18 individual bags but after you open one bag , it &apos;s impossible to even want to put yourself through that again. they are nasty ! ! ! avoid them at all cost ! ! yuck ! !
1	we have been buying cat grass for many years and this product is very well priced and works just as good as the expensive packages. our cats have &quot; grown &quot; healthy and happy since they have this grass. great seller - delivered on time and product sold is exactly what we wanted and will purchase again.
1	i bake , so i &apos;m rarely impressed by store bought cookies. this one , though .... divine. so divine. i don &apos;t like heavy chocolate , or dark chocolate , but i like a little chocolate. this cookie is the right amount pastry , raspberry and chocolate , and it &apos;s light , like a madeleine.
1	having always been a strict peet &apos;s coffee lover , i was reticent to switch brands but weaver &apos;s won my heart ! ! the taste is clean and strong , the ethos is correct ( organic , baby ) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate. be still my caffeinated heart !
0	i love it when it worked for the first 6 months. woke up one morning , dead ! never to be used again , too much to spend for 6 months of use. useless , do not recommend.
1	my cats favorite cat food he is very pickey and will not eat a lot of different cat foods but he loves this one
1	i combine this with libby &apos;s organic black beans and libby &apos;s organic green beans mixed with bob &apos;s red mill organic brown rice at least two or three times per week for a perfect meal every time !
1	this was the sweetest , smallest , hulless , best tasting white popcorn i have ever had. just placed an additional order for a 6 lb. bag as well as other varities carried by this company.
1	i have searched for hot chocolate for my keurig , but couldn &apos;t find any that were economical to purchase. i found this at a decent price , and was i glad ! my husband absolutely loves this hot chocolate and says it reminds him of his childhood. try it - you &apos;ll like it !
1	my puppy , megabyte , is a very picky puppy. after spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat. these are one of only two.
1	this is such a nice change from ordinary ketchup. more pizzaz ! i &apos;ve been putting it on everything ...... it &apos;s great on eggs and hash browns. i &apos;m glad i bought 6 bottles. shared some , and am going through the rest pretty fast. it &apos;s hard to find locally.
1	i purchased the hemp oil for my mom to help with pain relieve. the omega oils are suppose to help with join movement and pain. i have noticed that when she takes the vitamin her pain is less than the times that we are out and she has to wait.
0	these cost 69 cents a box in any grocery store. $ 9 for just one 7oz package ? how can this listing be serious ?
0	i was disappointed to receive earth &apos;s best organic snakin &apos; fruit rings banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.
0	this arrived today. the packaging was sealed but after opening the package i found that the cheap plastic cover was totally off the tamarind paste and the seal was even broken. obviously i won &apos;t be eating it.
1	i love these ......... very tasty ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! infact , i think i am addicted to them. buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag. savings are about a $ 1.00 a bag. i use subscribe and save on these and several other product. i love subscribe and save ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both. they had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange. i threw both items away.
0	i love pancakes , so giving up gluten was hard for me. i &apos;ve used bisquick for pancakes for years with great results. alas , the best i got from the gluten-free version was edible , but not enjoyable. it tasted a lot like pillow foam , not in a good way. i will probably keep the mix for breading things , but not for pancakes. i &apos;ve found much better options.
0	i love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.the combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst without leaving an unpleant after taste. t
1	i have drunk ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. i love this stuff in milk. it &apos;s much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. i am french and live in the us , and bring back boxes of ricore at every opportunity. savora is another hidden gem you can bring back. check it out.
0	capsules are .65 each direct from nespresso. capsules are .65 each direct from nespresso. capsules are .65 each direct from nespresso.
0	i dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing. i added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter , but it didnt make them taste good ..... it makes really sour things slightly sweeter .... but no miracle.
0	my sister told me about this popcorn , saying it is the best she ever had. wow , i must have gotten a bad batch. mine is very dry , crumbly and hully. the kernals fall to pieces and have so many pieces in hull in them , they are impossible to eat. will not purchase again !
0	one of the vials was broken when we received this product ... but you can &apos;t return the product or get a refund. what a rip off.
1	this coffee is very smooth but rather flat compared to starbuck &apos;s brews. it doesn &apos;t have any bite to it. if you like a mild coffee , you will enjoy this one.
0	i can get it at walmart for $ 1.78 each or the gas station for $ 3.50 for 2. why , just why ?
1	this dogfood has never been recalled , has protein as the first two ingredients , and is organic. doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness. cant get better !
0	i have ordered my pop chips from amazon for months. the last boxful was nasty. my whole family agreed and we threw them out. they tasted old and rancid. i wrote this to amazon and never heard a word back about it. i just cancelled my regular delivery.
1	best hot chocolate available for k-cups. best taste , after taste. great in any size when brewed. highly recommend over any other company.
0	i bought this based on the rave reviews posted previously -- but one of the main ingredients is msg. there &apos;s gotta be a way to make a good bbq rub that &apos;s not loaded with the stuff , which gives me and my wife nasty headaches .......
0	my 7 month old rottweiler broke the bottom lid off within a few minutes. the plastic is hard and when he tossed the product around by the rope it hit the ground and broke. now he just plays with the rope.
1	i have been looking for this candy for over a year ..... i used to enjoy this as a young kid and now its back ! ! all there is to say is yummy !
1	this is my wife &apos;s absolute favorite earl grey. me , i find that while the bergamot flavor is nice , i like a tea base that is a bit brisker.
1	totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread. i bought 3 to decorate a wedding cake &amp; used less than 1 / 2 of one ! it was beautiful &amp; worth the money.
1	100 % ground arabica beans. not my favorite , but not bad for a light / medium brew ... smells wonderful as it &apos;s flowing out of the kaldi machine. smooth and not bitter , slight floral ( ? ) aftertaste.
1	this is my favorite of all the choices of coffee for the new vue. i don &apos;t like strong-tasting coffee - i prefer dunkin donuts over starbucks. until they come out with a dunkin donuts vue pack , this light roast is perfect for me.
0	bronchipret made &amp; # 8203 ; &amp; # 8203 ; to order and sent us another product that did not correspond to the order. do not know why this has happened.
1	this is what black licorice should taste like ! no artificial off-flavor. no nasty artificial black dye to coat your tongue and teeth. wonderfully soft and chewy. i took a box into work and everyone agreed that it was the best black licorice that they had ever tasted.
0	there is no way that there is a decent amount of ghost pepper in this sauce. i have habernero sauce that is way hotter than this. according to the scovile scale that should be impossible. this was a waste of money
1	with all herbal treatments it is important to understand that the earlier in ilness one will start using them the better. i love to use herbal teas and find them very effective when used properly.
0	the product was advertizes as hot sausage ; s. the lable on jar say ; s &#91; hot sausage &#93; . but they not even warm . the sausage ; s do have agood flavor but just pickled. we have been serving these type of products at our vfw for year &apos;s so i know what i &apos;m talking about.
0	i of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch. i travel around europe extensively and there are several brands available there which aren &apos;t at all bad. this brand is ok for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards , etc. , but as a beverage , it rates rock bottom in my book.
1	great price for an excellent chip. at about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. everyone i &apos;ve let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. i &apos;ve yet to find a kettle chip that disappointed !
1	quality and delicious licorice ! and this is the best price / oz i could find for quality licorice anywhere. highly recommended , if you &apos;re into buying $ 30 worth of candy. ( you can subscribe for the lower price and then unsubscribe no problem )
0	my son loved the original recipe chick chick but happy baby has now changed the recipe. my son retched upon the first bite of the new meal. why do companies try to &quot; improve &quot; upon something that already works. i &apos;m guessing to cut corners somehow ( ie. cheaper ingredients ) . it &apos;s a shame. i now have a case of the new recipe that won &apos;t be eaten.
0	product arrived damaged and smashed up because packaging is cheap and inadequate to protect milk containers. milk was leaking out of box. i tried to return it but found out that this stuff is non-returnable. so if it arrives all beat up and leaking your stuck with it. given how expensive it is , you think they would properly package it.
0	i do most of my own baking , but i decided to order these out of curiosity. they all ended up in the trash. they are bitter and gritty. i understand that this is a problem with a lot of gluten free baked goods , but i have found ways around it. these were bad.
0	i like the maruman brand and was thrilled to find that this miso was organic , so i didn &apos;t hesitate to order. however , the product arrived spoiled , probably due to warping during shipping of the ultrathin plastic tub. disappointing.
1	at first you think that these chips aren &apos;t all that spicy , but the spice will grow on you with each bite. they are really very good !
1	out of curiosity i compared with side-by-side with tully &apos;s french roast k-cups. these green mountain k-cups do not have quite the full bodied flavor of tully &apos;s. both k-cups are good , but if you &apos;re going after a french roast with the most full spectrum and thickness of flavor then i &apos;d recommend tully &apos;s french roast k-cups.
1	i liked this so much that i re-ordered and will keep re-ordering.
1	these chocolate covered raisins are amazing. there is a nice balance between raisins and chocolate. i always pick up a container when i am shopping at bj &apos;s wholesale.
1	i ordered this product two times now and have been very happy with both the delivery and the product. it works great for cooking , baking and as a substitute sugar in my chai lattes.
1	these chips are very tasty , its a nice size serving and only 100 calories. good grab and go snack for busy moms
1	the coffee was good but didn &apos;t have a strong flavor. wouldn &apos;t buy this product again. nice to try new products and try new flavors.
1	ordered these for my daughters wedding cake overnight so that i would get them the next day they came four days after wedding but they are nice
1	stonewall kitchen products are a big favorite at our house. this pancake mix makes the best pancakes you will ever eat. we add fresh blueberries to them , and top them with the stonewall blueberry syrup , which you can buy on their website. they make wonderful jams and jellies too , as well as sauces , and flavored syrups. try this pancake mix though , you won &apos;t be disappointed !
1	our portuguese water dog has been trained on these bite sized little treats. he loves them and will do anything for them. good dog !
1	one of my dogs is allergic to almost everything in dog food. newman &apos;s own for senior dogs makes all the difference in her health.
0	purchased a couple of these to try out. were vacuum packed in plastic individually and terribly hard to open. they were very small in size for the price and the dogs ate them within a minute. usually a regular 8 &quot; -10 &quot; lasts them for 10-15 mins. would not buy again for that price.
1	this is a great idea , but i find that the grounds get into the coffee , and the coffee doesn &apos;t come out of the maker as nice as the regular kcups. it is messy as it comes out and misses the mug. it still is nice but is not quite as good as the orginal.
0	this tea left a bad taste in my mouth. i found it very difficult to drink because it caused acid issues. i enjoy timothy &apos;s white tea orange blossom much better and also the timothy cranberry.
1	these are the best snacks for me as i am a lap band patient. they fill u up just enough and the small bags are perfect size
0	if i could , i would give it zero stars. i am not a picky eater , but this mix did not rise ( can you say hockey puck ) , was extremely bitter , and not sweet even with the recommended amount of sweetener added. save your money.
1	my dogs loved these ... they were cheap too. only problem is they are oily to the touch ... given they outside is great !
0	i ordered this because i really like this brand and i have never had any issue with them. my son usually like all the flavors. i ordered this and the pears were sour / spoiled. the other flavors my son refused to eat. i am sure there was something wrong with it. so i am not sure what happened but i will not be buying these online anymore.
1	good , but i add a cup of whole wheat flour and a tsp. of baking powder along with a couple of tbsp. of cocoa powder because i like brownies a little higher and more cake like. they come yummy and with the added flour , they &apos;re not too sweet.
0	it says habenero peppers on the ingredients , but my guess is they just waved it over the closed bottle. smells like molasses and soy sauce. taste like molasses and soy sauce. absolutely boring.
0	i would we willing to try this product , and have six envelopes in my cupboard , but unfortunately the instructions are in german. maybe i can hire an interpreter ? ?
1	i also got the cherry one and this is just as good. it &apos;s a break from soda or water or coffee. i really liked the light refreshing taste and it doesn &apos;t fill you up like sodas can. it &apos;s very very tasty and it had a very fresh orange taste , not artificial tasting. i really liked it.
0	the chocolate cake is fantastic , so i had reason to think that this would be as well - not the case. it was very dense &amp; tasteless - totally unlike the airy , tasty chocolate. i want my money back or an even exchange for the chocolate cake mix.
1	i really like this gum. like all of wrigley &apos;s gum products i &apos;ve tried , this is absolutely great. these dessert delight flavors are truly delightful.
1	love these snacks ... great for a quick fix as well as a snack that doen &apos;t add the huge calories or fat that concerns many ! great taste as well as consistency !
1	this melitta cafe. collection riviera.sunset blend coffee is so full flavored , it &apos;s much better than other decafs we have tried , and really tastes like regular coffee ! which is great because awe enjoy aided coffee ian the summer so no worries about it keeping us awake all night. recommended !
0	this soup is advertised as &quot; creamy , &quot; however when it arrived it was &quot; signature. &quot; puck changed the recipe of the creamy butternut squash soup and is now calling it signature butternut squash soup. it does not taste the same ( and is not as good ) as the original recipe.
1	bar harbor clam chowder is an excellent product. easy to fix and has tremendous flavor , nice amount of clams and potatoes. you will enjoy this product very well !
1	not always available at our local stores. i love them. they are especially good watching football games , with you favorite malt beverage. this is a good deal , and super fast delivery , too. the nuts were fresh and tasty , as always.
1	it &apos;s almost eerie how this gum tastes so similar to actual key lime pie. i just picked up my first pack today , i this is definitely my new flavor. extra really hit the mark here. a different , unique , and incredibly delicious gum. this scrumptious , delicious treat is sure to please. don &apos;t hesitate to buy a pack !
0	these look very tasty and me being a candy freak i had to try them. to say the least i was extremely dissapointed. they have a chemical taste and the texture is like chewing glue. very nasty , i would never eat or buy these again and that goes for any of the flavors.
1	it &apos;s exactly what i wanted. it &apos;s yummy. make sure you eat your chocolate dip before the strawberry , because you won &apos;t like it the other way around. it &apos;s perfect.
1	i don &apos;t know how they do it but this product is too good to be true. half the calories of regular pasta ! ! wow.
1	i wish some of these companies would say whether the rice is white or brown rice. i try very hard to just eat the whole grain version of any grain as they are more nutrient dense ( plus lower glycemic ) . i &apos;ve not tried this yet , but if it was listed as brown rice flour , i would have put it in my cart.
1	i love the taste of this ras el hanout in my rice cooker for brown rice and quinoa. it makes the meal so much more special. large size too that will last awhile.
0	i always get the white chocolate with mixed nuts that tastes fantastic so this was on sale so i gave it a try. terrible taste.
0	these chips ( all flavors of the variety pack ) are really terrible. i have thrown away a lot of them and suffered through eating some of them. they are over spiced and nasty.
0	it may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal , but you can really taste the missing calories. i can &apos;t even eat it hot anymore , the &quot; apple &quot; flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. it makes me hate breakfast.
1	for the guy who love to saucethings up , here &apos;s the perfect gift and he will love the wooden crate packaging ! great idea and perfect gift : )
0	bought this coffee to take on vacation to use in the little 4-cup pots that are always in hotel rooms. my husband , the coffee drinker , said it was very weak ( even using two packs at one time ) . i threw away the rest. save your money ... buy something else.
1	my sweet daughter loves these. i mean what kid doesn &apos;t love pb &amp; j , and what mom loves not having to make it ! they are sweet , and make you feel like you are not missing out on anything being gluten free. highly recommend it !
1	juice consentrate is very good. i like it as much as the tart is smart and with the price increase it is considerably cheaper even with subscribe and save. this will be my staple tart cherry juice from now on. &quot;
0	we prefer the swiss miss brand k-cup. this one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. this is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.
1	we like this brownie mix and i usually use the low fat recipe on it. i also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry. we still buy this by the case.
1	this tea makes me sleep better than sleepy time tea. the taste is also pretty good. i make mine very concentrated with less than 3 ounces of hot water and i cover the mug top with a plate and wrap a towel around the whole thing and let it sit for as long as i can before i drink it.
1	i love these noodles. they are really great for a midnight snack. it &apos;s not really something that will fill you up for a dinner. if you do eat it for dinner , you will be hungry later. maybe some people wouldn &apos;t ! ! ! ! but , it just doesn &apos;t stick to my ribs. i love them though and amazon has a really good price.
1	very nice product full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets
0	i was disappointed in this product. too vinegary. i was expecting fresh asparagus stored in water. gave all of these away as we didnt care for the taste.
0	i bought this product thinking it would be a great substitute for lemon peel . i also wanted to save time from grating lemons . i put the product in lukewarm water to reconstitute it . it smelled like chemicals and tasted even worse . i make lemon bread to give as gifts , this product was totally unacceptable to put in my bread.
0	my puppy chewed through the rubber tug pull within a few mins. not worth the money.
1	i moved to las vegas from san jose last year and have been missing my peet &apos;s coffee jasmine downey pearls tea. when i saw this product i bought a shipment right away. i was not disappointed. i love the individual silken sachets of jasmine tea pearls. it is fragrant and wonderful tea. i will be buying it again.
1	i gave these packs out as christmas goodies , but saved myself one. delicious ! the gifts were well received also.
1	this 2 lb box of chocolates was a wonderful gift for my 20 year old niece ! the quality of the chocolates was amazing , but more importantly was the long lasting pleasure the young lady got. a double gift ! thanks amazon ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0042gwkwo &quot; &gt; see &apos;s candies 2 lb. assorted chocolates &lt; / a &gt;
0	i ordered this for gifts around christmas time. i actually was hoping to use it for our christmas day meal. two out of the four jars i ordered were rotten and inedible. i never did get to try it and i was very annoyed and disappointed !
1	i find it is difficult to find black tea in the united states that is of decent quality. i love pg tips. it brews up nice and rich and is reasonably priced.
1	grove square hot cocoa is just the right amout of milk chocolate , not to much chocolate , just the right mixture. delicious ! i say a good cup of hot chocolate. try grove square hot cocoa , milk chocolate k cups for keurig coffee makers. enjoy ! i did.
0	please stay away from artificial sweetners. some of them actually change the shape of human cells. this has an artificial sweetner
1	well packed. few are broken but it is understandable. the cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting. my friends and i really enjoyed it ! thx !
1	i love this gum. it is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find. i was hooked on the cinnamon extra until that went away. now this item is not available. this world needs more cinnamon lovers.
1	melitta &apos;s rich , flavourful product is a delicious treat comparable to coffees with a much higher price tag. it is a plus that the decaffeinated version does not sacrifice flavour. highly recommended.
1	i love this tea and drink it at least twice a day. the flavor is both strong and sweet. the tea stands on it &apos;s own , never needing sweetner. if you &apos;re a cinnamon lover , you have to try this tea. and even if you &apos;re not , it &apos;s worth a try.
0	these tasted so artifical &amp; funky ! and now i &apos;m stuck with 9 lbs of them. i tried strawberry banana rings at a local frozen yogurt shop that were delish &amp; found this great deal &amp; ordered assuming they &apos;d taste the same. boy was i wrong. these are gross ! ! ! !
1	originally i was turned of by this product when i tasted the regular flavor. once i had the version with pineapples , i was instantly hooked. i used to get a lot of stomach cramps and cramps in my feet. since i have incorporated this drink daily it has aided my digestive system and obliterated all of my previous cramp problems. i would recommend vita coco to all of my friends and family.
1	this is a blessing to those of us who are gf. there are so many things we can make again now that we have bisquick ! not to mention that pancakes finally taste like pancakes again ! how nice to be able to have a biscuit with dinner again ! since gf products are so expensive the best place to get it is at amazon on the automatic shipment plan. it &apos;s great !
1	i found this stuff to be very tasty , great with jasmine rice or just as a snack. i don &apos;t mind a little msg if it enhances the flavor.
1	we live in the middle of nowhere so we end up ordering a lot of spices etc. that can &apos;t be found locally. this gives great chipotle taste with just a little sprinkled on. i &apos;m going to order a few more of these because i never want to run out of it.
0	very good product in a pop-open can that has design flaw. when my package arrived some of the cans had popped open and there was tuna-smelling oil everywhere.
1	this waffle and pancake mix is delicious ! you can taste a subtle hint of vanilla in them. they are the only pancakes / waffles that my kids love and the house smells wonderful when they are cooking !
1	these are healthy and my mixed llasa , tibetan terrier adores them. and they are healthy and his breath doesn &apos;t smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products. a great healthy product.
1	i liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea. i use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge. very good cold and needs no sweetening as is lightly sweet already. doesn &apos;t look pretty , but does look like a healthy drink ! i liked it !
1	stingers are better tasting and more convenient than gels and work just as well to provide energy when exercising over long periods of time.
1	the local merchants quit stocking this. was pleased to buy this on line so i can make french canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. all of bob &apos;s red mill products are 5 star.
1	these are a great alternative to chips. i wasn &apos;t sure how they would be based on other reviews but i am glad i bought them and wish i would of found them sooner. i have twin 18 month olds and they can &apos;t get enough of them. i like them too !
0	i do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don &apos;t like. the smell isn &apos;t that great either
0	these are very tasty , but way too sweet &amp; sugary. i felt like i was eating candy instead of meat. if that &apos;s okay with you , then you &apos;ll probably love these , but i was looking for something a bit healthier. yes , i know it says &apos; sweet &apos; in the product name , but i bought it because of the no hormone , no antibiotic , no artificial ingredient aspect.
0	i purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. wrong ! i like chocolate chip and i like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don &apos;t work well together. i wish i had read the item listing more carefully. even my kids said &quot; blech ! &quot; .
1	walker &apos;s highlanders are my favorite purchased cookie , so it was great to find them pre-packaged into 2 biscuits. keeps them fresh longer and limits my snacking !
1	i became addicted to eating these the first time i tasted them which was years ago. once you eat one , you just can &apos;t stop until they &apos;re gone. they aren &apos;t too sweet and make the perfect snack. i love these things ! ! !
1	my box of grove square hot cocoa arrived today and i &apos;ve just tried it. delicious. made a big cup &#91; by mistake &#93; but i &apos;m happy with the flavor and consistency. no off tastes that i can discern. a little disappointed at high sodium content. nice to have as fall starts to chill.
1	i don &apos;t usually drink tea but i love this one. i thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that i had to get it. perfect with a little bit of honey.
1	i love this candy. after weight watchers i had to cut back but still have a craving for it.
1	we enjoy these peanut butter and jelly bars. my 5 year old with celiac disease says he can have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich again. he loves to pack these for school snack.
1	i started giving these to my daughter when she was 9 months. she loved them so much her first word was cracker ( while signing more ) ! they dissolve in her mouth so i don &apos;t have to worry about choking. and they are healthy too. i highly recommend it.
1	i ordered 100 disposakups. they came fast and were just what was advertised. i will definitely be re-ordering. thanks alot ! !
1	this was my first purchase of this water. it tastes great and the bottles are thicker than most. also , everyone likes that name ... haha
1	these organic energy bites are delicious and work great. i use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides. a few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity.
0	13 dollars for 24 cups free shipping over 50 dollars is the going rate. these folks are pulling a swiftie
1	they have a bad taste , i finish giving them away because my son started to cry everytime i tried to give these.i prefer beech nut or gerber.yuck !
1	we used to have a pipeline to get homemade dulce de leche from a bonafide argentine , but alas , said pipeline moved away. this is the next best thing and doesn &apos;t involve me hanging out in the kitchen for hours while my milk caramelizes.
1	we are into our third can of this flavorful and easy mix and it just seems to get better and better ! sunday is pancake day at our house , and today we had blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup. this mix holds fresh blueberries nicely - don &apos;t over-mix the ingredients and you will get nice , fluffy fruit-filled ( or not ) pancakes that are absolutely first-rate.
0	i wish i could say that i &apos;ve tried this and love it , however , i can &apos;t because i haven &apos;t received it yet. it &apos;s been over 2 weeks since i made this purchase and it hasn &apos;t even shipped yet ; and when i bought this it said it was in stock , so i don &apos;t know what &apos;s taking so long. i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll buy this again because the wait is ridiculous.
1	i put this in my dog &apos;s stocking for christmas. he was very pleased with the snack. he likes regular sweet potato fries , so i thought a package of dog ones would make him happy.
0	i was disappointed with my order of 2 cans of coopers lme. one can expired one month before i recieved it. the other can was newer but very dented and damaged. i will not be ordering cans of liquid malt extract from here again.
1	we recieved the product on time and in excellent shape. it tastes good and meets our expectations. thanks for the excellent service.
1	this deal on amazon with the prime free shipping , and / or the even cheaper subscription is very tempting if you make a lot of desserts with this like we do. one of our favorites is layered graham crackers , this pudding mixed with frozen whipped topping , and topped with a can of melted chocolate frosting. lots of stores are discontinuing name brands , so this is a great item to buy here.
1	i use this to record in garageband on my macbook. it works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. i love the level knob and the quality construction. if you read the instructions and use it correctly , this tool is invaluable.
1	great sauce ! used in many jamaican restaurants to help with the heat of the jerk seasoning. most use walkerwood jerk seasoning to make the jerk and pour this on later on the jerk or the rice.
0	i agree with paul. i had a sick cat and was looking for a deal online. the solid gold tuna looks like 6 oz in the ad but was really 3 oz. i looked everywhere for a weight , also. i ended up paying more for this online than if i would have purchased it at petco.
1	i hope amazon always carries this product too. i have ordered it twice. excellent product for the price. yum-o !
1	i really love this mix as the pancakes are so soft and fluffy. could not tell that they were gluten free. i also made carrot muffins with it and they turned out good.
1	i have always liked the oskri bars ... but these with the fennel in them are even tastier. a great gluten free , no cane sugar , no cornsyup , treat for those being health conscious. also get a little protein to boot ! mmmmmmm mm !
1	i &apos;m not one to believe in supplements , but this product was the only thing that helped my anxiety. i was getting really bad panic attacks from what my doctor said was anxiety. i feel overall much healthier after taking this product and i haven &apos;t had barely any anxiety issues. definitely recommend this to anyone that is trying to tame their high stress or anxiety.
0	i have been a loyal pop chip customer for a while now and wanted to try some of the new flavors. i ordered the variety pack on sept 15th and it said in stock. now exactly a month later i have still not even received and eta on when they might be shipped. i am very disappointed ! ! !
0	i was incredibly disappointed with this jerky. i ordered the krave curry flavor , and all i can taste is sugar ! the meat is indeed moist , which ... i feel defeats the purpose of jerky. jerky is supposed to be dried meat. will definitely not order anything from krave again.
0	defintely not as tasty as the madhouse munchies which are my family &apos;s favorite. kettle &apos;s are dark / burnt , more broken bits , taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. oh well.
1	my big boy oreo loves this so much. i took him off beef products and only give him venison rabbit , turkey. he can &apos;t get enough of this stuff
1	my dog would have to stop breathing before she would fail to perform for liver biscotti. even my friends with finicky dogs are surprised how their dogs love the stuff.
0	this is not for me. it was like eating a bowl of fat. not my preference. everyone is different. personally i dont like this at all.
1	this baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons. i take it for acid indigestion and heart burn. just a 1 tsp in a half glass of water and it &apos;s gone. i use it to make my body more alkaline , so it &apos;s great for changing your ph level in your body !
0	dunno where the alleged 6 pack went. i received one 2lb box of biscuits. don &apos;t be misguided by false advertising. on another iams order from another supplier received what i had ordered.
1	i was a little concerned to buy the popcorn , as you never know what you are going to get. but i did and i am glad i did. the popcorn is nice and tender , pops easy , great taste and hull-less. i have moved from the microwave popcorns and glad i did because of this product. i like the fact the the popped corn is small but great !
0	the breakfast cookie is not to my liking and i do not think i will order them in the future !
1	i am just passing along the 5-star rating from our three miniature schnauzers. this stuff is a big hit at our house. we give them each an easy to digest kibble that &apos;s good for them and put a tablespoon of pot pie on top. no more turned up noses now - they wolf it all down. be sure to mix it up real good before serving.
1	this item was received early. it was packaged well and in excellent shape ! this was a gift and i am sure it will be received well. after all , ferrero chocolates .. what &apos;s not to like ! ! ! thanks for the excellent service. would use this seller again and would highly recommend ! !
1	i &apos;ve eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they &apos;ve always been terrible. i didn &apos;t expect much when i bought these. but after i tasted them i was amazed. i have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these. they have a natural potato flavor with thick , crunchy chips. the only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open. use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.
0	order full box , tastes horrible. no one will eat it , brought it to the office , few people tried it and spit it out. bought it because of reviews , hopefully no one else buys it.
0	dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on any of the foods that i tried.
1	sticks and twigs may seem a little pricey compared to regular pretzels , but the bag lasts a long time and the ingredients , like flax seeds , quinoa , chia seeds and curry , are good for you. they are very crunchy , but tasty. for some added protein , i like to dip them in peanut butter.
0	these chips taste so dry and gross , i would rather eat carrots or something than these. they just didn &apos;t satisfy the salty craving and weren &apos;t worth the calories.
1	i &apos;m a huge popcorn fan and have tried all sorts , and the amish country brand popcorn is the best i &apos;ve ever eaten. absolutely delicious !
1	coffee has a great flavor and is not too acidic. fits perfectly in out &quot; juan valdez &quot; pod maker that was purchased at target several years ago ! so hard to find these so was glad to find them on amazon !
0	absolutely no cheese flavor at all. all you can taste is salt salt salt. save your money and try something else.
1	i have used your product for years and find myself in a town where they are sold only in very small bottles. i am used to buying your product by the half gallon and would like to make my purchases online. i have tried using other products which pale in comparison to your original barbecue sauce.
1	these are the best jerky strips i have ever tasted. our family has been eating them for years and they are typically a christmas delight.
1	i love the taste of this soda. it &apos;s sweet with no bitter aftertaste that can be found in some orange sodas. i &apos;d never guess this was a natural drink from the taste alone. my only complaint would be the serving size. it &apos;s correct for a serving size but not what i &apos;m used to in a soda can. ( 12 oz. )
1	i tried this snack because it looked healthy , so i didn &apos;t expect it to be too great. i was wrong --- it is very very good ! i &apos;ll buy more when my supply runs low. john d
1	this is a joy to serve on my mini potato pancakes with sour cream and then a teaspoon of this caviar on top. soooooo tasty and pretty for christmas. thanks for offering it.
0	its difficult to rate dog food. i guess you look at the ingredients and if your dog eats it then its good. well the ingredients were great but my dog didnt like it and its pretty pricey. thats all i can say.
0	this is twice as expensive as basic box mac and cheese. it is just so so in taste. if you check the ingredients it is not much different than other mac and cheese. the cost does not justify the ordering. i will not be ordering from amazon again. the cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.
0	these tablets hardly work in comparison with the actual berries. if you want flavor tripping then buy a box of the synsepalum dulcificum berries or grow your own plant instead of wasting money on the pill / tablets. in my opinion.
1	tasty , convenient bars for people with celiac disease. they seem to have gotten smaller over time , but the taste and convenience outweigh the reduction in size ( and the price ) .
1	i really like this soup. it is mild and i don &apos;t like anything that is to hot. it is just right. has a good flavor and is something i can take to work and pop in the microwave. i would buy it again and again.
0	the plant was upside down in the box and i had to put the roots back inside the planter. it never came out of shock and turned black and died.
1	received this product much sooner than promised. seeds grow as claimed and plant is great. my cat loves it. highly recommend product and seller.
1	i certainly hope that switch will be selling this product in larger packages - i was very disappointed when my tangerine soda was gone - it was very good ! actually tasted like tangerines , which was a surprise as most of the sodas on the market don &apos;t have much distinctive flavor at all. switch sodas are pleasantly carbonated , sweet without being overwhelming so , and very satisfying , particularly when drunk very cold !
0	i &apos;ve purchased a number of newman &apos;s own products for me and my dogs. this is the first time that i &apos;ve been completely disappointed. don &apos;t bother with these mints - there is very little cinammon flavor and there is a flavor that tastes something like dirt.
1	this is a very tasty item. my wife doesn &apos;t eat meat and had to stay in a hotel for 4 weeks during a training she attended. i had this shipped to her and she raved about the great flavor and wanted more !
0	while my english setter likes the busy buddy tug-a-jug , it didn &apos;t last a day. he chewed the rope off and emptied the treats quite swiftly. i think it would be great for a dog that doesn &apos;t chew thru things.
1	can &apos;t be the price ! the beans have a strong aroma and tasted great in creme brulee ! just be sure to have an air-tight jar and a vacuum sealer isn &apos;t a bad idea either to keep them as long as possible.
1	excellent taste for a low calorie snack. this size bag is exactly 100 calories and you get a lot of chips. i prefer these to the regular greasy chips.
1	i use this in my breadmaker but make it with warm milk and an additional egg , which greatly improves the texture. when made with just water and a small amount of butter , the crust comes out very , very chewy in my breadmachine. i have also made this bread and used carrot juice in place of the water , which makes it a beautiful color and naturally sweet.
1	this is a good quality brand of chocolate with many flavours of which this is just one. very tasty and a fast delivery too
1	i love these soy crisps. they are the perfect salty crunch. i have a hard time finding snack foods that don &apos;t have wheat , corn , or some sort of sugar sweetener in them. but these fit the bill. they are * very * salty , tho. i like them that way , but if you &apos;re not used to it and can be kindof surprising.
1	the &apos; sun chips &apos; are an ok substitute for the usual potato , corn , whatever chip cooked in oil and over salted. they are not nearly as un-palatable as i thought they would be. have added them to my &apos; heart healthy &apos; diet regime. all are good except for the &apos; multi-grain &apos; style , which has the texture of a sheet of plywood.
0	my cat will not eat this food. i don &apos;t know why , but it was a waste of money. i was looking for something cheap so i guess you get what you pay for.
1	i am so happy to have discovered these chips. i hate stealing a phrase from another product , but they melt in your mouth. i have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag , air popped chips. do try them people !
1	i love the fact that this has so much iron in it. i &apos;m a vegan and it &apos;s not easy to get enought iron. the molasses isn &apos;t quite as tasty as some i &apos;ve had , but it has about 5 times more iron , so i &apos;m ok with it. i don &apos;t think anyone would buy molasses online if they just wanted a tasty food , so i guess it &apos;s a winner.
1	wasa has a great line of &apos; crackers &apos; , but these have become my favorite. they are light but not wimpy. their flavor is fairly neutral so they don &apos;t conflict with whatever you choose to put on them. and for me , the calorie count was the final winner ... only 20 calories per cracker and low sodium. a winner all the way around and amazon has the absolute best price !
0	i thought i was getting a healthy alternative to cheese its and cheese nips. but after comparing the labels , i was surprised to see that the back to nature ones have basically the same ingredients ( nothing organic ) and much more sodium than the major brands. seems they just put regular crackers in a &apos; healthy &apos; looking box and got away with charging a premium.
0	having lots of problems with green mountain cups. coffee is fine , but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup , but drips considerably when removing to dispose. will probably choose other brands in the future instead. have been using k-cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand.
1	always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal , finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in.
0	this flavor sounded like it would be good , like ice creamy , and it seemed to get lots of positive reviews here on amazon. so when i came across a small sample box at lowe &apos;s of the stuff , i bought it. unfortunately. this &quot; coffee &quot; tastes like old dishwater in which a pair of running shoes and a vanilla-scented car air freshener were steeped for a week.
1	my daughter and i were looking for some real licorice and after reading several reviews about different brands of licorice we ordered the panda licorice. we are very happy with panda and will order again soon.
1	no matter how you mess up the recipe , this mix still makes my family happy in the sunday morning : )
0	there was absolutly no scent or flavor to this.when i brought home truffles from aosta in italy they were wonderful and cost less. these were worthless.
1	organic , fair trade , cafe altura coffee brews a great pot of coffee. &apos; organic &apos; makes it healthy , and &apos; fair trade &apos; makes it a responsible choice. the dark blend is a flavorful choice.
1	i ordered personal items for the first time from amazon and i was very satisfied. the product came shipped securely and the description of the product matched perfectly. i will order again going forward. amazon has not disappointed yet. i love the dove body wash ! it smells very fresh and clean and really keeps the skin moisturized well. i have combination skin.
0	the lids do not fit. coffee runs out of the pod. a total waste of money. there are other filters on the market that are much better.
1	finally a great and easy gf option for pancakes , waffles , biscuits , etc from bisquick ! ! both of my kids have celiac and absolutley love this stuff. wish the container was bigger. but we &apos;re just happy to have better tasting options for breakfast now. thank you , thank you , thank you. can &apos;t taste a difference , but the rest of the family uses the cheaper stuff.
0	the first ball worked pretty well , it just looked a little beaten up. since then , ~ half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water ( all of them do after sitting for a bit ) . if you don &apos;t mind the rate of failure , the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being steeped for a long time ( especially considering that it is white tea ) .
1	i love popchips ! ! these are the best. individual serving bags , flavors are great , taste is excellent. my daughter and grandson love the barbeque. i have found that buying them through amazon is cheaper and amazon offers the bigger bags also. i have to watch that because i could eat the whole bag.
1	i was at a 5 star hotel and was served this tea during a meeting. it was fantastic. i asked the server if they could get me the name of the company , but they were unable. thank goodness for amazon i was able to find it. it &apos;s the best i have had in many years. it arrived on time and very securely packed.
1	i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience ! thank you !
0	if you really have to reduce your acid and still want coffee i suppose you &apos;ll try anything but for me this coffee has low flavor no matter how strong you brew it. it reminds me of budget hotel room coffee. just not for me.
1	i repeat , carbonated fruit drinks can be too sugary. this drink reminds me of other orange soda brands without the extra sugar that combined with the metallic can always leaves an odd taste in my mouth. orangina has a bit more flavor , but switch tangerine orange is light and refreshing , .
1	i like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha. this dark chocolate flavor is quite nice , especially mixed with double black diamond coffee. though not the very best , it is good , and the price is right , compared to other brands.
1	one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. this formula is one of the few she can eat , and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. both of my kitties are very active , have soft shiny fur , and neither are fat. dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth , also.
0	do not buy this blend if you prefer dark and bold coffee and / or if you like coffee that can hold cream. it is weak in flavor and best described as tea flavored coffee. it is , however , not bitter and fairly smooth.
1	good flavor ! these came securely packed ... they were fresh and delicious ! i love these twizzlers !
0	there really needs to be information on these sorts of products on the amount contained in the jar. many people like to know how much per ounce they are buying.
1	although the kernels may not be as large and fluffy when popped , we really enjoyed our first pop. has a great flavor and consistency. we recommend using a hot air popper over a microwave. we had very few no-pops.
0	salt and vinegar is just ok to me. they are not in the same league of utz salt and vinegar potato chips. just ok not enough taste to them.
0	my dog was too small to move the covers with her mouth or paws- i don &apos;t recommend for any dog under 20 lbs !
0	google &quot; propylene glycol &quot; to find out why. i bought this product , along with several others , without running the ingredients by my wife first ( a nurse of 30 years ) she was surprised when she noticed it .. we went a googling , and poured my $ 50 order down the drain afterwards. there &apos;s &quot; pure &quot; and then there &apos;s &quot; not so much &quot; .....
1	the customer service was beyond compare. i would gladly do business with this company again.
1	this mix makes great tasting waffles. a little extra work and expense but worth it. need to stretch the recipe a little bit to make 2 full waffles on my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker.
0	short on flavor and not as advertised. says no sugar but doesn &apos;t admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. my teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. i did not like it at all. is it better than drinking pop ? probably but does the high price warrant the small differences ?
1	i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there. he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day. good stuff !
1	this stuff is amazing ! fast shipping and most of all the best tasting sugar free low calorie item on the market. bravo ! i use it in my coffee and its a real treat. thank you ! will be ordering more very soon.
1	i think namaste gluten free spice cake mix is their best but vanilla cake is pretty good , too. i especially like it with whipped cream and strawberry sauce with a dash of ground orange peel. in my oven , the mix bakes better in muffin cups or a muffin pan than in a rectangular pan.
0	ordered this to try some old school cocktails that called for it , not realizing that orgeat is widely available as coffee shop syrup shots. this would have perhaps been a better and cheaper ( because of the shipping costs ) choice. it is usable at best.
1	bought these for my grandbabies and they love them. i love them because they are organic. only the best for my little guys. my big guys even snack on them.
1	revolution &apos;s teas are superb. smooth and delicate , each one has been pleasant , comforting and a pure delight. i &apos;ve tried this one , the pomegranate , as well as ginger peach , dragon eye oolong , and white pear.
1	awesome ! ! ! such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. i will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful.
1	my dogs love this natural kibble. it &apos;s simple ( only rice and protein ) yet tasty. they maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements. wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog &apos;s diet and keep it out of their food.
1	my husband enjoyed this coffee. we usually use newman &apos;s extra bold but thought we would try something different. it was a bit too strong for me ; i prefer newman &apos;s. but it was still good.
0	caviar taste awful. maybe it &apos;s because i bought from a cheaper brand or maybe because cavier is just bad no matter who you buy it from or how much you paid for it ? why do people like to waste money on these things ?
1	this version is ground. not my current cat &apos;s favorite version , but he really likes the taste. i do wish they &apos;d make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too. my previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean. but , neither wanted it more than once or twice a month. why , i don &apos;t know but it seems to be a little richer than the others.
1	excellent i needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found newmansbon the internet. it has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived
1	my grandson loves this. he makes a cup everytime he stops over. it quick and easy and the taste is good.
1	i usually make pancakes from scratch and have never found a mix that doesn &apos;t taste &quot; off &quot; to me. this mix is the best ! ! ! my family and i love the way it tastes and it is so quick and easy.
0	i love twinings lady grey but the most recent batch was pretty bad. regardless of how i brew it i get an odd odor that masks the characteristic lady grey aroma. i used some older tea under exactly the same conditions and got a perfect cup. i &apos;ve got 6 tins of this stuff and it is a lost cause.
1	my doc has strictly limited me on what i can and cannot eat. i can use this salad dressing and was pleased to find it in bulk at a great price. good taste.
1	our family loves spam and amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk. the 7-ounce size is perfect for our use. amazing what you can use spam for. add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats ! super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought !
0	my dogs loves this chicken but its a product from china , so we wont be buying it anymore. its very hard to find any chicken products made in the usa but they are out there , but this one isnt. its too bad too because its a good product but i wont take any chances till they know what is going on with the china imports.
0	unfortunately , most of the flavor in peanut butter is in the oil ( fat ) . here they remove that and then tell you to put in water to replace it. you won &apos;t end up with peanut butter ; you end up with thin , slightly peanut-flavored &apos; stuff &apos; . buy it but don &apos;t expect anything else.
1	as a long time tea drinker , was happy to come across this iced tea mix. it serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing. i find this iced tea very refreshing. i really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content. the plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry. the blueberry is good too ; it &apos;s unsweetened , so i add half a packet of truvia.
1	gevalia kaffee is by far the best coffee on the market. especially the coastarican peaberry and the peruvian organic.
1	my subscription of popchips arrived on time and not damaged. i love the fact that i receive a great variety of chips which are healthier and at the same time very tasty and satisfying. the way the chips are packed for shipping is perfect ! having a subscription is the way to go and of course the price is so right ! ! ! thank you ,
0	this coffee tastes so nasty i can &apos;t even drink it. it &apos;s disgusting. i can &apos;t believe anything this bitter is acid free. i actually threw away two bags.
0	i really wanted to like this coffee but it was bland and did not remind me of any french roast i &apos;ve ever had. it was smooth. we put in our solofil k cups and think the grind was too fine for the machine.
1	i &apos;m happy with the quality of the product and the price. like the other reviewer , i would prefer if there was a plastic liner to preserve freshness. however , i will continue to buy this product regardless as it is quality oatmeal at a good price. edit : i &apos;m on my 4th bag , quality continues to be high.
1	it &apos;s not as good as i hoped , but canned chowder never is. i added some butter , a can of chopped clams , and some milk - then thickened it a bit. it works great as a base , but not for me straight out of the can.
0	this item arrived with a horrible mess. broken and sticky. i want my money back ! i am so dissappointed. i expected better from amazon.
1	this &quot; squeezy fruit &quot; as my daughter calls it , is great. convenient , yummy , no added sugar ... i love it. i just don &apos;t understand why it is so expensive ? ? i find it at the grocery store for $ 2 for a four pack. don &apos;t pay this price , that &apos;s crazy !
1	i make this product when we have any kind of tex-mex meal. everyone loves it. it is easy to make and tastes great.
1	yes , i am having a cup right now. i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee. i paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money. highly recommend.
1	bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great ! too bad i don &apos;t have one of those machines , otherwise , i &apos;d try them out myself. i might have to consider getting one ! if you really like it , you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don &apos;t run out.
1	great taste. great ingredients. great texture. absolutely delicious ! they are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal. i give one to my 5 year old son for breakfast and he is still a little hungry for more. either that or they taste so good he wants more.
1	i used extra yeast and a little more water and it came out very light with a heard crust , which i like. i will order it again. not much of a potato taste but good bread
0	my 2 year old cindy has developed an allergic reaction to a new bag of this purina cat chow indoor formula food. she has been throwing up all over the rugs and floors when she used to be so careful about cleanliness ! i am starting to suspect quality control. i will never buy this product again.
1	this was a very good puchase. the shipper was very fast and very friendly. the tahini was very fresh and of good quality. i will order again.
0	i love these crackers , but recently ordered a case for my daughter &apos;s baby shower - out of 6 boxes i got about 24 whole crackers - the rest were broken , most were crumbs. very disappointing.
0	just got this seasoning last night and made some turkey tacos with it ..... they were extremely nasty ..... absolutely no flavor ..... i mean i understand that its a no salt seasoning but man , it tasted horrible and has made me sick. i will just try a low salt taco seasoning until i find a no salt one that is at least bareable and doesnt make me sick .... under no circumstances buy this .....
0	the product description says 12 packs of 12 ( 144 count ) , but when you order , you only get a box of twelve. i did this weeks ago , talked to amazon , but they still haven &apos;t updated the product description.
0	this isn &apos;t the one i had ten years ago ( brand forgotten ) . it is nearly ok. strong after taste , flavor is fake. if anyone reading this knows what brand is great , please post so i can try out. the original one i tried was incredible , thus my fruitless search for perfection.
1	i bought this kit after i really enjoyed making the tropical riesling from the same manufacturer. it was equally easy to make , but it is very peary. i wouldn &apos;t have minded it if it was more subtle. still very drinkable , but i suspect that i &apos;ll be mixing it more.
1	in cold weather , i brew this tea by the pot , keep it simmering , and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea , by the cup , made with this as the base. my husband will drink it , and i can &apos;t get him to use any other medicinal. ( hates licorise. ) it helped a great deal last winter.
1	french roast my green mountain is my favorite every day k-cup. its a good coffee ... bold yet smooth. not burnt ( i hate peets and starbucks because they taste like the burn the beans ) . if you like the nasty burnt taste , these probably are not for you. if you want a well balanced , bold , smooth everyday coffee these k-cups will work !
1	the variety pack is the way to go when buying in bulk. my 9-month old daughter loves all of the flavors.
0	i just threw out $ 25 worth of this and other flavors i bought from another company online. i bought because of the good reviews right here. i remember horehound being stout and an acquired taste. this brand barely has any flavour at all. if you want real horehound look elsewhere.
0	our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other happy baby foods ( she loves the gobble-gobble &amp; mango-spinach-pear ) . however , this one makes her throw up every time ! she is not allergic to anything in the ingredients - i can only guess that the high tomato content is just too acidic for her tummy.
1	these cookies are just enough when you crave a sweet little snack. my 3 yr.old granddaughter likes to say the letter before she pops it in her mouth.
0	just plain nasty ! ! ! this item tasted like cardboard , very watered down and no flavor to it at all. very disappointed
0	it could be worse. the pineapple , which is not well-advertised on the package , is actually the best part. the worst part is the large discs of ... turnip ? i &apos;m not even sure. sauce is bland. pass it up , go with the bbq chicken or zesty marinara.
1	i toss some of these in soups , or hydrate in a bit of hot water and add to salads or salad dressings. they add a nice somewhat meaty flavor , ( almost like bacon bits but healthy ) , to almost any dish.
0	my 10 month old baby hates this stuff ! ! i &apos;ve tried giving it to him on 4 separate occasions-but everytime he tastes it--he makes a disgusted look and won &apos;t eat anymore. i even tried mixing it with his favorite foods and he just takes one bite and looses his appetite and won &apos;t eat anymore of anything for the rest of the night !
1	smooth coffee , but a bit to big for senseo , interestingly all the other melitta one pod flavors fit just fine in senseo , my fav are french kisses and vanilla haze.
1	i must say that vitakraft has put life back into my dog. he is old and vitakraft offers him more vitamins and minerals than what he was getting from his food. now he has more energy and begs for these choco drops.
1	i love these wild cherry tic tacs and they are impossible to find in stores. i am so glad that i can get them from amazon and the price is excellent ! they are a great low calorie treat and i will keep buying them from amazon. highly recommend this purchase !
1	stores are not carrying this product - thank goodness i can still get them ! ! ! ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000cmhmuc &quot; &gt; genisoy soy crisps , deep sea salted , 3.85-ounce bags ( pack of 12 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	while good quality , it was not at all what i expected. it smelled like caramel and vanilla , but it tasted like straight black coffee. i was pretty disappointed.
0	i was recently diagnosed w / gestational diabetes ... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar ... this isn &apos;t it. i &apos;m giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i &apos;m going to try the other flavors , but this one definitely is not one i &apos;d like to have again.
1	i am hooked on it. it &apos;s just wonderful. highly recommended for taste and flavor and price. i &apos;ve tried different teas from different restaurants and tea houses , but i just love this one for home. i use it nearly every day. will be trying more of these teas in the future.
1	strong , dark , intense. strong enough for a man but mellow enough for a woman. it really is a good coffee with no bitter after taste. i just love it. it &apos;s good with cream and sweetner with no watered down taste or just plain. wish they made a decaf then i could drink it 24 / 7.
1	the nuts used tasted very fresh. the bite sized chunks were just right. it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. very satisfying = )
0	they are charging $ 1.00 per k-cup i saw this and decided to go to keurig.com and these same k-cups are half price
0	the packaging was okay on the easter eggs but they were all melted and the chocolate was white , very grose ! we couldn &apos;t even eat them we had to throw them away. it would have been the same as throwing the money in the trash.
1	nothing can compare to the waffle mix delivered by stonewall kitchen. my mom complained about the price but i think the quality deserves the higher price than the regular pancake / waffle mix. the waffle comes out golden and crispy. i was using the presto 03510 flipside waffle maker.
1	not bad at all when i use coffeemate chocolate creamer. i still like swiss mix made with 2 % milk a little better. but as far k-cups go , this milk chocolate with the coffeemate chocolate creamer is not bad. and currently , it is less than $ 11.00 for 24 cups.
0	i got this product ship one day express. unfortunately , when it arrived and i opened it , all i saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with little macadamia nuts in the center of the holders.
1	the product arrived undamaged just as it was described on the website. no delays and arrived quickly. the customer was satisfied with the quality and arrival of order.
0	the one i got says &quot; cleanse &quot; on the box , i don &apos;t know what it means , but i know that i picked the one that doesn &apos;t say &quot; cleanse &quot; on the box. i &apos;m all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i &apos;m not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive
1	my two siberian cats refused almost a dozen canned foods , but this , they could not get enough of ! thank you ! a superb supplement to their dry food diet.
1	this is the second time i have ordered this product. i was happy enough the first time to place an order again. cookies were fine and delivery was very quick. thank you.
1	with jack links buying king b , it looks like they have repackaged the original beef jerky strips in this label with the same great results. i hope they keep up with the demand as everyone else finds them as i did. thanks for bring them back jack links !
0	i paid 2.99 a fifteen ounce jar or roughly 9 bucks for three. grossly overpriced here. avoid this ripoff and look for cheaper. also when measured out this fifteen ounce was barely more than an eight ounce cup. the fifteen ounces are not by liquid measure but by actual weight. &amp; # 128078 ;
0	this is terrible popcorn ! no taste , poor popping ratio. and the size omg ! i popped this gourmet popping corn in front of a party , everyone busted out in laughter !
1	i like them as a midmorning snack with a cup of coffee. they are also great for those mornings you really aren &apos;t in the mood for breakfast , but know you &apos;ll be hungry later. they seem to keep you satisfied for an hour or two. they do taste great - not too sweet and not overly cake-like. buy a bunch and keep them in the freezer until you need more.
1	this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for christmas ! ! thanks for a reliable , easy shopping experience.
1	i would recommend this product. i received it in a timely manner and the price was good.
1	my 1 yr old granddaughter , and i cannot get enough. and it is good for you !
1	i have recently joined jenny craig as i need to lose some weight , and these 100 calorie pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks. i appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. i have agreed to take a shipment each month.
1	so far , i &apos;ve only had time to make waffles with this new gf bisquick , but they were delicious. sometimes with gluten free products , you have to use other weird ingredients , or processes to make them. these waffles were super fast , easy , and seriously delicious. can &apos;t wait to make other things !
1	great packaging , and item is just as described. will purchase this item again. they were shipped very fast , and efficient.
1	this is a nice , refreshing carbonated drink. it has no added sugar , as advertised. but its name is a bit misleading. the &quot; orange tangerine &quot; also has some apple and grape juice added. the grape is not a great addition to the blend , so i wasn &apos;t thrilled with the flavor.
1	i &apos;m very pleased with this dog food. haven &apos;t ordered anything else for my dogs since i bought this. my lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and i &apos;m happy that it is healthy for them.
0	you can buy the same bag of chocolate at any michaels store for $ 2.99. i got a ton of bags on sale for $ 1.99 there ! don &apos;t waste your money or your time waiting for this bag
0	deceptive ad. you can buy from green mountain for $ 13.95 a box of 24. don &apos;t buy from these crooks.
1	i drank this coffee over 30 years ago when i lived in the netherlands. so glad that i can get it through amazon. strong , full bodied but easy on the tummy ! ! !
0	i had recently tried pocket coffee a friend brought back from italy. and it was one of the best chocolate i ever had ! i searched and brought this product at amazon ... but i am extremely disappointed ... this is not the same as what you can get from italy. &quot; instant maxwell coffee &quot; in the middle of &quot; hershey &apos;s chocolate &quot; just doesn &apos;t compare with the real thing ...
0	it did not really taste like much , so i was able to add sauce without interrupting the flavor , however i could not get past the texture. i &apos;d rather chew on rubber bands.
0	i find that spike is too salty for me. i like the similar product called vegit much better , it &apos;s a little more savory and less salty than spike. made by the same people , too.
1	i ordered this for my mother-in-law who could not find this product anywhere near where she lives. she is really enjoying this product.
1	this 24-pack lasted about a month , and i sampled all of the flavors but only got to eat the barbecue flavor once , as it is my wife &apos;s and my favorite. so , i reordered just the barbecue. great snack for 100 calories. i &apos;ve purchased the reduced fat pringles 100-calorie individual packs before , and you get a lot more chips in a popchips bag than from pringles.
1	i received the k-cups on time and in execellant condition. i usually drink coffee , but at night the hot cocoa is good with a snack , just before bed.
1	husband and grandaughter love this cocoa ... make it for them all the time as i drink my coffee .. my husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house .. loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
1	as a long time yerba mate and coffee drinker , runa &apos;s traditional guayusa has switched me over permanently ! the super smooth and sweet flavor to this &quot; tea &quot; gives it the same drinkability of any other stimulant based drink , but with the lasting power and complexity as any high end tea. drink up !
1	four people in my family tasted this orange tangerine drink. it tasted good to all four people , and agreement from all four is difficult. it does not taste like a soft drink , but much better. if you are looking for a fiz that is tart , this is your drink.
0	sugar free instant chocolate pudding / pie filling is priced low and but tastes just like unpleasant metallic which i never expected it to be. was disappointed and will not order sugar-free again.
1	good variety of the flavors , makes it helpful to sample for your choice of type you prefer. also good for packed lunches or as a portioned snack.
1	for people watching weight or nutrition , these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips. they have plenty of protein as well. amazon &apos;s price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store.
1	i would recommend this as a good basic coffee. it has a satisfying flavor and will make many a good cup of coffee. i prefer drinking my coffee black and i found this to be produce a good cup. it is not bitter and even though i had the decaffeinated coffee , it did not taste flat like so many decafs do.
0	thought i had died and gone to heaven when i made the bisquit recipe. i was wrong ! went to indigestion hell. i had serious hope for this product. i truley loved the mix , but it didn &apos;t love me. i haven &apos;t had indigestion since i gave up gluten until i ate a bisquit from this mix. best luck on getting it right bisquick.
0	it is unfortunate that the wording of this item description doesn &apos;t make it clear that this is artificial flavor. real vanilla is always brown because vanilla beans are brown. the artificial vanillas are by-products of wood processing and contain petro chemicals. do your taste buds and body a favor - use the real stuff even though your cake / frosting will not be pure white.
0	i love hot chocolate , but i found this mix repulsive. there wasn &apos;t a strong chocolate flavor and the other flavor notes where far too sweet. i had to throw it away. i will never purchase this again.
0	we bought the large one for our dog thinking it was a neat idea to keep him occupied ( and it is a really good idea for a toy ) but apparently our 20lb dog has jaws of steel because the plastic broke the first time he played with it. he &apos;s not not a monster dog by any means but this just couldn &apos;t hold up to my dog.
0	the product is not fresh when they send it because it is not sealed. the lid on mine was leaking. it was kind of gross.
1	dogs love them and they are made the best way , they are about $ 4.00 cheaper that the pet stores and no tax
1	ok this poor guy begged my daughter to make him my pecan pie and well she is a microwave girl ! so for christmass what better way to a man than his stomach. he now has pies he can pack in his lunch box. they are sssooooo good.
1	i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like. these chips have a great loaded potato flavor , which are flavorful. i like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips. kettle chips are great chips f / the money !
1	i don &apos;t review much , but i have been buying this brand for my irish wolfhound for over 2 years now. he still loves it and it &apos;s good for him. if you have a large breed dog , this dog food will be a good choice for healthy food.
0	ordered 2 both had bent tracks and i actually cut my finger on one of the wires sticking out. but you get what you pay for ....
0	i was very dissapointed in this product because the tops were not sealed properly on about half of them and ended up throwing half of them away ! i will not order this product again
1	this is the best hot cocoa product i have found for the keurig k-cup brewer. the others i have tried do not have the test or alot of the product remains in the cup.
0	terrible clunky product .. drawer doesn &apos;t open / close without making clunky noises. not a space saver , hard on the eyes. would return it for a refund if i weren &apos;t terribly lazy. go to bed bath and beyond and use a 20 % off coupon for something else. not worth it.
1	this product is great and so is the company i had problem with the post office and they were right there to resolve the issue this is a great gift to yourself or to others
1	i don &apos;t know how everyone else got these broken , but when i received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap , not a single jar was broken. my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all.
1	this is a great product and would highly recommend to all keurig fans. you can make your own k cups at a fraction of the cost.
1	i am trying to eat healthy and could not really find any good tasting low fat snacks. my friend told me about pop chips that she bought from amazon. she said she loved them and i should give them a try , i said what the heck if she likes them they must be good. and what do you know i loved them and i have a bag almost everyday for a snack
1	i love uncle ray &apos;s potatoe chips. they have alot of spice on each chip. they taste spicy with a tang of sweet. when i order a box , i pass them out to friends who love them. my husband , my kids and i eat a whole bag at a time. i limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. the salt content makes me blow up , but i still love them.
0	this product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date ! ? ! i don &apos;t know but i &apos;ll not buy this again.
1	my wife like these better that the swedish version , wasa , as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product. we will buy again.
1	great candy and our family loved it. it was smaller than i imagined it and i thought it was expensive for how small it was. however , i am in germany and can get it easier here. the shipping to the usa makes it expenive. great product and fun for our usa family to receive.
1	this has become a breakfast staple for our home. now nearly every sunday morning , we are making pancakes. we &apos;ve got the vermont mapel syrup , eggs , sausage or bacon and we &apos;re set for the day with a just a light snack-type dinner. use bettermilk for the absolute best results.
1	fantastic tasting potato chips. i love the individual bags , great for kids and adults too. no trans fat , no cholesterol , no artifical stuff. low in sodium and high in potassium , which is great for people like me with hbp. only problem is amazon is out of stock some times and price is high.
0	the us made version of this cadbury chocolate has a distinct taste from the uk version of the chocolate which i have been eating since childhood. i did not like this new taste. to all my friends from india -- buy this chocolate if it is either made in uk or india ; otherwise you will be disappointed as i was.
1	thanks for having it sent to me promptly. i was very happy to be able to order it online and get it the next couple days.
1	this is great dog food , my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him.
1	this drink has a wonderful orange citrus flavor. it is robust but not too strong. a great natural alternative to soda. my 13 year old likes it as well. would not hesitate to purchase.
1	this is the perfect food for my cat &amp; in fact , the only one she will eat - wet or dry.
0	i ordered a lot of this licorice but i am so disappointed that they are very old and hard i wanted to return them and get my money back but i just found out i can not return them i am so upset and i want to get my money back.
1	finally-a gluten free pancake product ! pancakes not to bad , taste like regular bisquick. the batter is just right , not too heavy pancakes. this was a good price compared to local grocers.
0	unfortunately , i somehow stumbled upon this product and , based on all the glowing reviews , bought a case. upon opening the first bag and eating a couple , i was disgusted by the taste. worst thing i &apos;ve ever ordered from amazon---and i &apos;ve ordered a lot. i don &apos;t think the nutritional values are all that great , either.
1	great product and priced well , we &apos;ve ordered this several times over the past few years and really like their walnut oil , packaged well and ships on time , will keep ordering this product from the same seller
0	several of the seller &apos;s listings indicate 20 % kona blend ..... but the delivered product does not have this package printing. as a long-time kona coffee drinker , the contents are more indicative of 10 % ( or less ) kona coffee. have ordered twice .... and completely disappointed.
1	shipping great and loved product. the boxes are a little tough because there is not a lid if you do not finish. i suggest buy only little ones this way.
0	i love peanut satay. this product is truly terrible. in no way does it resemble that dish. oily , salty and tastes lousy. don &apos;t waste your money on this brand.
1	i have a 7 yr old w / food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these. i have compared to several other cookie / snack items made with no dairy &amp; eggs and i think we all liked these the best. definitely a must have for restricted diets.
0	i bought these from a large chain pet store. after reading the reviews i checked the bag ... made in china. i threw the whole bag away. i wish i would have read the reviews first !
1	i had heard about their prickly pear tea in a forum and decided to try it since i hadn &apos;t had any since i was in arizona. it was better than i remembered ! i tried it first hot and then used the remainder for ice tea and both were really good. the company delivered super fast too which was great. i recommend this tea highly , particularly if you like prickly pear teas.
1	tried the bbq popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren &apos;t that great. good healthy snack without giving up the taste. so glad i discovered these ! salt and vinegar are my favorite ! 100 cal / bag , 3.5g fat / bag
0	i usually never give bad reviews to products but this is so bad. i have peanut butter daily , i love it so much. i got this to mix into smoothies but it is far too salty to use that way. it taste nothing like peanut butter. it is just gross.
1	excellent - will order again ! ! it &apos;s nice to be able to order omaha items from amazon because amazon ships sooo fast , and payments are so convenient.
0	very disappointed with purchase. the dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates. must have been sitting there for a long long time.
0	i thought i was buying non pareil candy ( like snowcaps ) , but instead it was a container of sprinkles. i &apos;ll find a use for them , but i was hoping for a stocking stuffer ( heck maybe i &apos;ll make it stocking stuffer andyway ) . i would have been better to see a picture of the container- so i knew it wasn &apos;t candy.
1	i &apos;ve tried ever single brand of k-cup hot chocolate and this is absolutely the best one. it is the only one that actually tastes like the real stuff.
1	my wife rates this 5 stars. she is the chocoholic in the family and if you please her ... you please everybody .
1	my kids have been begging for hot cocoa k-cups and when i found these so reasonably priced i decided to give them a try. we all loved them.
1	this gum is amazing. the flavor burst in your mouth and it also has a wonderful refreshing sensation. we love it. ( my husband and i.
1	love van houtte k cups. the selections provided allow one to sample coffees from different regions as well as taste the &quot; flavored &quot; coffees without having to buy a complete box of each. then , you can pick the ones you like &amp; buy that particular coffee .. great concept !
0	lowrey &apos;s has changed it &apos;s microwave pork rinds. i used to love them. the last order i received was put up in a generic paper container with really flimsy cellophane wrapping. there is no writing on the paper sack whatsoever. the taste is sub par as is the amount of rinds. as i said , i used to love the product. i will buy no more lowrey &apos;s microwave pork rinds.
0	thank god that i tasted the metal before i swallowed them. i dont even get how it got mixed up with this. the candy itself is sex in mouth.
1	we love to make hummus , and love to make sandwitches , salad dressings. one of our kids favorite foods is tahini over cold undon noodles.
0	like other reviewers , i rarely eat cookies because i have an anaphylactic response to wheat / gluten. therefore i generally &apos; love &apos; any cookies i &apos;m not allergic to. these are an exception. the taste is mild and fleeting. the texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. the only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting , because they are simply inedible. blah.
1	i &apos;ve eaten a lot of sardines in my life and by far these are the best. the extra cost of boneless / skinless is worth it cos there is more to eat and less waste. love the water packed instead of the gooeyness of oil. excellent
0	i got a tiny twig ! no rocks or decorations ... doesn &apos;t even look like a tree ! ! not happy ! they have pictures of bonsais that would be good for a gift , but i would be really embarrased to give the tree that i got as a present !
0	i guess my palate is not as sophisticated as i had thought. i &apos;m a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. i tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. i have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. i gave mine away ( ananomously ) .
1	my wife and i tried this product a few days ago. we were not disappointed. the coffee had a good flavor , and the low acid was a nice added benefit.
1	fennel tea is the best herbal tea i have been able to find and seelect is the best-tasting brand of those i have tried.
0	i was not thrilled by the taste of this coffee. it was a little too weak for me. i will try the bolder kind next time. this one just tasted to watered down
0	my 3 cats are not at all picky about what they eat. they &apos;ll happily gobble everything from meow mix / friskies through royal canin and iams. but this food - no way - they will not touch it. sad.
1	this has been the best tasting stevia i have tried. i also think this is a better value than some of the others. i really like not having to open all the packets when i make a gallon of tea.
1	the 180 snacks almond pops with blueberries are the best. i love the bite sized pieces. the flavor is fantastic. very crunchy , not too sweet , nutty and fruit flavored at the same time. the perfect healty snack.
1	product arrived on time , nicely packaged and gift wrapped , the treats were all quality and very good. nice keepsake box.
0	this kind of tea not good .... ! taste and smell so wear it &apos;s not like tea , and feel like some thing chemical.
0	i &apos;ve purchased the golden malted natural pancake and waffle flour in the past and was excited to see the blueberry on amazon. i received the mixes yesterday and am very disappointed. it has little flavor and waffles are not as light as the regular mix , possibly due to the expiration date being 2 weeks from today.
1	this is a wonderful product , i was happy to see i could buy it on amazon because our local stores quit carrying it ! we use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing .. yummy ! it can be used on almost everything. love it !
0	i decided to deter from my usual brand and try this. i like a strong green tea but using the same measurement i usually use with this brand was so weak i might as well have just used the entire container.
0	do not spend your money on this product as you will find the popping ratio extremely poor. one cup of popcorn will have 1 / 2 cup of un poped ( old mades ) kernels left over which is unacceptable.this is a non returnable item so if you buy this one you are just out of luck , so i recommend staying away from this one.
1	my girls love these bars ! they are nice for lunches or quick snacks on the go ! good flavor ! gluten free and dairy free is difficult , but bakery on main does it right ! yummy
0	this stuff tastes ok , but its consistency is way too thick. if you like whole milk you might like this , but i couldn &apos;t stand it. i much prefer almond breeze ( un-sweetened ) .
1	i &apos;ve been using this sauce for over 9 years now. it &apos;s amazing. i use it on everything from spring rolls to salads.
1	chilling in the fridge seems to boost the flavor even more ; and using them , rather than corn chips , to make nachos will have your tastebuds singing like janet jackson. ( but without any of the associated wardrobe risks. ( - : ) highly recommended.
0	material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded. the only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap , but i guess sometimes you get what you pay for.
1	despite coming in an extremely large box , i found this to be great value. all the bags were preserved with a reasonable expiration date that is months away. i &apos;d definitely recommend.
1	my first exposure to patchi choclates was in abu dhabi , where patchi stores are found aplenty. now that we are back in the states , amazon is the only place i &apos;ve been able to find patchi. hooray ! the chocolates are as rich and delicious as i remember. if you have never enjoyed patchi chocolates - do yourself a favor and buy some !
1	great stuff and dependable , especially when there are a million brands &quot; out there &quot; to choose from. i love the stuff. for really high end desires , i go with the apollo olive oils from california. but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again.
1	so far grove square has the best hot chocolate k-cups. we have tried a couple others but they don &apos;t compare.
1	i found it so hard to believe anyone could give this mix 1 star , i had to read those reviews. two of them seem like ads for robs red mill , and the other one didn &apos;t make any sense. you must be looking for pancakes or waffles , so do yourself a favor and give these a go. they are delicious
1	i find it hard to express how pleased i was to find bisquick in a gluten free form. i have tried countless recipes using mixtures of rice , and potato flour and none of them tasted good. the bisquick bisquits are delicious , but unfortunatly i couldn &apos;t make satisfactory dumplings with the mix.
0	i expected the flavor to be more like that of &quot; brewed &quot; green tea. it really does taste like dried green tea leaves simply dissolved in water. although i &apos;m sure this is probably a good way to get a concentrated amount of antioxidants , i wouldn &apos;t order this again.
1	these are better than the usual canned fish filets , tastier , and not dry. there are no bones or skins. i worried about mackerel but they are much nicer than , say , kippered herring filets or sardines in oil. it &apos;s easy to pour off the olive oil if that is a worry , but you &apos;d be losing something that is also tasty.
1	this coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee i have ever tasted , and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner.
0	the 80 count pack is incorrectly advertised as costing .01 per count ... that would make the package cost 80 cents ... not close to 50 dollars
1	very good hot chocolate. i have tried a few different brands , and this one is the best i have tried. should be priced higher for the quality you get.
1	everything you &apos;d want from a hot chocolate ... creamy , milky , tasty , makes you happy : ) i can &apos;t wait to try the other flavors !
0	the flavor of what pops is good but only half the corn pops. i know its not my poper because started using the oil and salt from these packages and different seeds.
1	my husband and i both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste , but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have. this community hazelnut has excellent flavor. we make it fairly strong and are very pleased with this coffee.
0	it might be a matter of taste , but this is the worst cup of coffee i ever attempted to try. my spouse and i tried three sips and dumped it.
0	these almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. i love salt but this was over the top. i &apos;ve bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty. maybe the machine went wacko when processing these. ? ? ? i can &apos;t eat these unless i take the time to try and wipe off the salt , which talks forever ! !
1	these are the best chips ever and what a great swap for all the fat and calories of regular chips. not to mention that they come in single servings so when you eat the whole bag it &apos;s ok ! ! ! great product and i would highly recommend it anyone.
0	pure toxic garbage. eat poison if you want to. toxic metals. go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. look at all the high ratings. apparently people love eating toxic metals. not harmful ? would you eat sodium mercury phosphate ? enjoy your metals.
1	this bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy
0	this is awful tasting and for the price with shipping turned out to be $ 10 a bottle. bought for my son &apos;s birthday party and some of the boys were puking and gaging it was so bad. you are better off buying a bottle of franks hot sauce and chugging it down ... at least it tastes good. this was my biggest rip-off buy ever ! ! !
1	i sampled this cake as offered from biscoff 1 month ago and fell in love. it is extremely moist and is most delicious when sliced thin to accompany a cup of coffee. the ingredients are perfectly blended as no one taste is overpowering , but you are able to taste each individual ingredient. if you are looking for a great coffee or tea accompaniment , please give this cake a try !
0	sending it back to amazon. most of the cans have large dents in them. the bubble wrap around the cans is fine , the box is fine , so i assume the cans were shipped with the dents.
0	the taste is good , but i found myself biting down on small bits of lobster shells more often than acceptable. this made me not want to finish my bowl of soup.
0	these k-cups arrived in a timely fashion but when i &apos;ve tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. it seems there is not enough coffee in them. i wrote a complaint to van houtte and they did not respond ... so i &apos;ve got nearly 50 cups that when brewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. not happy.
1	i &apos;m a crunchaholic ! i have to have something during the day to crunch ! all other chips are so high in fat or sodium that it makes it very difficult to be eating healthy and still get my crunch on. popchips is the answer and the individual bags are a great way to control your calories too ! i highly recommend them all , but the salt and pepper are my least favorite !
1	great for you ! grind them up and add a few tablespoons. can &apos;t tell it &apos;s there in your cereal ect ..
1	i love this product. all of the different flavors are fantastic. my family likes the 3 grain the best. no more corn tortilla chips in this house !
1	we &apos;ve tried every coffee brand available for the keurig , and this one is , by far , the best. it &apos;s extraordinarily smooth and rich - the closest to starbucks , if that &apos;s your thing. i add to it a healthy splash of bolthouse coffee / mocha - very good.
0	just a heads up about this shirt. it has a nice color and nice feel to it , however when i put deodorant on it left a huge stain. that is not suppose to happen , also i washed it and had shout on it for a while and it still didn &apos;t come out &amp; the shirt shrunk tremendouly. would not recommend.
0	at one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure. sadly , there &apos;s nothing left to enjoy in these dry , flavorless packing peanuts.
0	i used to say i &apos;d never buy my groceries at a hardwhare store , but chef boyardee is cheep there. .88 / can. then they go on sale even cheaper.
1	these tomatoes are perfect for italian recipes ..... full flavor , not too acidic and very italian ! always the best choice for italian cooking ....
1	these are hard to find , but worth the trouble. very tasty and very reasonably priced. love the product , and received very quickly.
0	i found this product doing a search for &quot; edible gold leaf. &quot; i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. however .. it is clearly marked &quot; not to be consumed &quot; and &quot; for decorative use only. &quot; so this is a misleading product.
1	i have really fallen for flavored coffees and i consider these to be some of the best-- so much so that i &apos;m on the regular shipment list now. i &apos;m sure i drink too much of this but i love the flavors. try it , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll like it.
0	wow , i had high hopes for a great addition to my low carb diet , but these rinds were very disappointing. tried several bags , but could not get the cooking time right. taste was dreadful , texture downright rocky. i guess i &apos;ll stick to off the shelf rinds. won &apos;t be getting these again. can &apos;t recommend , and would warn of anyone asking for my opinion.
0	well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies.
0	now if you could just make it sugar-free also ? i know , i don &apos;t want for much. : - ) &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b004391dk0 &quot; &gt; bisquick pancake and baking mix , gluten-free , 16-ounce boxes ( pack of 3 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	i &apos;ve bought them many times. good quality and good taste , baby love it , and i love it too. reccommend it.
1	as far as gluten free products this is awesome. i use it as a substitute for any recipe that asks for flour. it makes great pumpkin waffles.
0	believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of mcvitie &apos;s digestive biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on april 2011. if i had known you were going to do that i would not have bought them. please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.
1	these brown rice cakes are by far the best , i have tried many. i can not have very many foods. these are my only snack food that i can have. they are so good i dont feel like i am missing anything.
0	did not smell as fresh as i had hoped. my cat was uninterested. trader joe &apos;s has organic catnip that comes with a scratcher for $ 6.99 which smells much more potent. maybe try a different brand ?
1	these were good for a snack but found it a little expensive for the size they come in.
1	we &apos;ve tried pamela &apos;s ( second best ) , bob &apos;s red mill and king arthur &apos;s gluten free flour mixes. for pancakes , waffles , breading , pie crusts , biscuits and dumplings , bisquick has been the most reliable performer. we whole heartedly recommend it for those who bake at home but need to avoid gluten ! !
1	i have tried another brand of one cup coffee making. these made the job easy and no mess. the other method had a plastic holder and lid and a paper basket. you disposed of the inserted paper basket only. the plastic would be very warm to the touch at the very least. then you had to rinse the plastic holder and top for any grinds that might have escaped.
1	bottom line , these crackers are a great snack. ordering by the case saves some money compared to the $ 3.45 charged locally. whether plain , onion , or sesame ( i &apos;ve never tried the wasabi ) these are a low fat , reasonable calorie snack eaten either plain or with something on it. the only sad thing is that i first ordered them in 2008 for $ 21 per case.
0	hi - ordered the venus fly trap ... very quick service , nice vendor , but the plant died and turned black ... over the next 3 days after we got it ...
0	kobe beef comes from a specific prefecture in japan and is illegal to import in to the united states. in fact , it has been illegal to import since 2010 in any form. this is just overpriced regular american beef.
1	i really like these. they are so light and airy , almost like chips instead of cookies ! the flavor is that yummy oreo chocolate we all know and love !
1	pros : free super saving shipping , small , juicy taste , diffrent flavors , and healthy .. cons : sometimes seller only haves 12 vs 36. to order .. i like to have several packs ..
1	sent this basket to my father for his birthday. he said the fruit was very fresh and sweet. happy with this healthy purchase !
1	we love earth &apos;s best organic baby food , but this is not the tastiest one. i &apos;ve tried it myself and think it is pretty gross. but my daughter still eats it , just not with as much enthusiasm as other flavors. it &apos;s got a decent amount of protein , which is important for us as a vegetarian family.
0	my puppy paw paw hates this stuff.and i hate it to. it get &apos;s my whole house plus the inside of the toy stink. and my next door neighboor dog fluffy the bichon frise ate this stuff one time and ended up in the emergenciey room ! but she is better but needs to rest for a couple days.
1	great alternative to dog food with corn and other by-products. our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do i , knowing it is better their health.
0	i was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix. i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried , but was diappointed in this specific one.
1	i am glad i was able to find these on this site. i love this flavor and they are so crunchy. the box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. most of the bags survived in tact.
0	i bought this because of all the great reviews , but unfortunately neither one of my two dogs were at all interested.
0	first off let me say i am a foodie. the 2 &quot; energy &quot; bars tasted terrible. of course the other 3 ice cream products are delicious. but for almost $ 17.00 it is not worth it. oh and the magnet is just a advertisement and didn &apos;t stick to the fridge.
0	the soup is rich and tasty , but don &apos;t buy it from amazon. the packaging is so poor that the cans arive dented as did the replacement shipment. i got my money back but now have to pay more to buy this wonderful soup from my local grocer.
1	made really great biscuits ; even my non-gf husband enjoyed them ! my only complaint would be that the packages aren &apos;t very big ; i used 2 cups to make a batch of biscuits and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s even 1 cup left in the package.
1	my chihuahua loves these lil snacks. when she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles !
0	my daughter is not very picky , and would usually eat anything. i got her to eat about half a pouch the first time i introduced them to her , but it was a losing battle after that. they don &apos;t smell pleasant nor do they look appetizing. i really wanted to like these too , because they looked to be quite healthy.
1	these are really excellent breakfast bars. note to the previous reviewer : the nutrigrain bars , last i checked , had artificial color in them. these don &apos;t. they also taste very good. this is our third order through amazon ( great price ) and my daughter misses them when we &apos;re out.
1	well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest .. not bad great product
0	im not buying anything from british delights. or amazon ever again.their portions are wayyy tooo small.goodbye rip offs : ) both companies do not care about their customers.its kind of sad : (
0	i &apos;ve heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. i couldn &apos;t eat them though , they just don &apos;t taste good to me personally. my grandmother loved them though and i gave the rest to her.
1	the content has been consistantly good. the calamares have been tasty. the price was also very reasonable
0	all five packages were too small , too old , and all were full of mold ! will not buy this brand again.
1	my son with multiple food allergies really enjoys these bars. i find that they have a good berry taste. they also have a nice chewyness.
0	purchased two liters ... looking for an oil to put in salads , on bread , etc ... something with a strong flavor of olive oil ... this is not it. this is good for cooking ... has little flavor.
1	i love little white kernels of popped corn. this was good stuff , but i think i &apos;ll try a larger white kernel to pop next time , my preference.
1	dum dum lolly pops are the best ! they come i lots of kinds and tast really good !
1	i like loose tea and hate having to clean out the metal holders. these bags are ideal as they let me make a pot or just a cup of tea and then throw it in the compost pile to be reused for my garden.
0	the product was hard as a rock. i could not even break it in half. both dogs had hard time chewing them. puppy could not either will not get product again. unless the two packages i got were old and dried out.
0	way , way , way overpriced. when they first came out , i bought it at a walgreen &apos;s for $ 5.99 , and that &apos;s about what it worth.
0	glutino crackers are among our favorite gf crackers , but if you have a store in your area that sells them , that might be a better bet. about half of our crackers ( in all 6 boxes ) arrived broken.
0	my baby likes it but i think it &apos;s too much sugar. it &apos;s made from concentrate , so it tastes artificial. try fruitables instead. it has vegetable and fruit juices , less sugar , and tastes much better. good price on amazon.
1	i have three small dogs and these are one of their favorite treats ! i don &apos;t have to worry about them choking and i feel i am giving them a healthy treat ! please don &apos;t ever stop making them pet n shape.
1	this product is great for pancakes. for baked goods i blend bisquick ( 2 / 3 part ) with pamela &apos;s bread mix ( 1 / 3 part ) for great gluten-free / dairy-free treats. the bread mix makes it less crumbly.
0	when you taste these you only get the taste of salt. either the package i got came from the batch amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt. i have these only because the roland kalamata pitted ( whole ) olives have been out of stock for couple month. as result had to dispose to trash rolan kalamata halves.
1	good quality nectar. very tasty. however , i was expecting 46 fluid ounces , not 46 ounces in weight. i find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces.
1	last night they predicted an ice storm and i was going to have the day off for mlk , so i knew that this was the day to make soup. this one is excellent ! my only addition to the recipe was a ham bone and about a cup of rice. it made a great , satisfying supper. pat
1	i &apos;ve been buying this milk hot chocolate for months now and it &apos;s one of the best i &apos;ve had. i even got my in-laws hooked on it and my granddaughters absolutely love it ! great price , great product !
1	green tea is good for you , loaded with antioxidants , boosts your metabolism , yadda , yadda , yadda , but i never quite warmed up to the taste. until now. the lemon and the ginger give this a very nice flavor. and it is so great that i can just add a packet to my water bottle and go , without the bother of brewing it.
0	i &apos;ve been using this for the past few years , but this year , i &apos;ve not only found the bugs , but i actually have a weed that grew and punctured through the bag ! i kept wondering where all the weeds were coming from in my planter boxes , and now i know !
1	usually , healthy food is hard to swallow. not these , fresh , crunchy , delicious pumpkin seeds. i switched from potato chips and my wife tells me they are good for the prostate. what do i know ? i &apos;m taking her word for it.
1	i only ever had pumpkin seeds before in cereal , in small amounts. these are great ; just add them to bob &apos;s granola , or yogurt ; even just plain by the handful , they are great.
1	wimpy coffee drinkers beware , this is not the bean for you. if you like strong , bold flavor , you have found it in larry &apos;s. what a great coffee , starbucks move over , larry is in first place ! !
1	this coffee is bold , dark and tasty. unlike many other types that are too watery and weak this one brews nice and strong cup of coffee.
1	i really like this tea , i started drinking it at the suggestion of a friend. it helps to sooth an upset stomache. i will be buying it again in the future.
1	all the chi chi &apos;s closed in my area. i was able to get this mix at the grocery store , but lately it has not been on the shelves. i am so happy to have found it on amazon. this mix is awesome. great for taco night ! ! !
0	this product would be better made with milk , which of course , then would not be for the keurig machine. there are other brands i prefer.
0	the kiwi berry drink may not have sugar addded , but it sure tastes sweet. part of it may be the other fruit jucices mixed in ( apple , grape , raspberry , and strawberry ) with more apple and grape than kiwi. for me it was too sweet and did not taste too much like kiwi fruit.
0	pork roll can be ordered directly from the company in nj for a lot less - four boxes of preslice is the smallest you can order , a bit expensive to ship - but arrives fresh and ready to enjoy
0	it &apos;s distracting to drink something that smells like pipe tobacco , so i am not giving this product a high personal rating. also , i like my fruit drinks more authentic , with fewer mystery ingredients and preservatives added. this product is so well preserved , they recommend keeping it in the refrigerator , not the freezer.
0	i was so disappointed when i found out there were only 22 cups. the other packs , for similar flavored coffees , were double the number of k-cups for the same price. i feel cheated.
1	i put my orange switch in the refrigerator overnight to make it nice and cold , and i had it with breakfast. i love the taste of it - mostly orange , with a hint of carbonation. it tastes sweet naturally and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s good for you. i would buy this product : - )
1	i recieved a keurig k-cup brewer for christmas with sample cups of coffee and tea but no cocoa so i tried this brand and i like them but i haven &apos;t tried other brands yet to compare with. i would buy these again until i find one i like better.
1	whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie ! the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast. hope these don &apos;t go the way of the dinosaur !
0	i received the package today. it is so not worth the money. definitely should not an will not buy this one.
1	we love this pancake / waffle mix. it &apos;s hard to please everyone but this item does the trick. crispy , light , tender , yummy !
1	this is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store. if you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity. this is a good deal and super easy to use.
1	purchased case of 6 cans from amazon.com for &#91; ... &#93; bucks including shipping. good quality slow cooking oatmeal. good shelf life on cans. this is the slow cooking type 20-40 minutes depending on preference. taste is good.
1	switch is a fantastic replacement for sodas. you still enjoy having the carbonation but with fruit juice. it is very satisfying.
1	great value and much superior to what you find in stores. makes a great snack or after dinner treat , but for those who are health conscious remember to keep it to a few pieces since they are covered in thin sugar. try to keep the bag tightly sealed once you open them since the slowly begin to dry up. will be ordering more soon : )
1	crackers are great. was glad to find them. there is a good selection of flavors. my favorite is salted , but there are other choices.
0	the flavor is not that great. i would prefer something with a little more flavor , tastes like cheap coffee. i would not this purchase again.
0	i &apos;ve bought this product many times and this time ( 11 / 10 ) they are old or defective. the bags don &apos;t puff up and rinds are flat , stale &amp; burn when cooked. i &apos;ve tried different time settings and in different microwaves. i &apos;m very dissapointed as this is a product i &apos;ve been ordering for years. guess i &apos;ll have to call them and complain.
1	product arrived earlier than expected and was just what i expected - an easy and cheap way to make my own keurig k-cups. great for company. everyone gets what they want without having to buy a whole box of k-cups. i just buy a few of the little one pot coffee packages and can make whatever someone wants. awesome !
1	same stable and good quality of meiji yan yan. when i got the good deal from amazon.com , the price is even better than those available in local asian store , which is really rare.
1	very refreshing ! ingredients are 3 different fruit juices , sparkling water , and no sugar ! about 150 calories per can , and they &apos;re smaller than regular soda cans. so the ingredients are pretty natural , but 150 calories might be too much for some people !
0	i ordered these for work and they came all in a box , no problem. there was a problem with some of them being broken and leaking all over. i wrote an email to the seller letting them know that but to this date , still havent heard a word from , them .. good customer service.
1	i &apos;ve tried tons of gf pancake mixes. i could choke on most of them or just decide not to ever eat pancakes again. these are so moist and delicious. my 92 year old grandmother was just diagnosed with celiac disease. she loves them too. my wife and children who are not gf also love them. m
0	the crackers were all broken up and in crumbs. i felt like i completly wasted my money buying this.
1	there are two types of larger suckers sold on amazon , i got the tropical ones this time. just as good as the regular kind. these ones have a mixture of sour and sweeter parts. well worth the money.
0	the packet of these seeds that i received must have been old because i don &apos;t believe even 10 % of them grew. i tried some several times in soil and water and only got a few sprigs of grass. i garden regularly ( i live in florida ) so it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t know how , and i even followed the instructions to the letter , but they did not grow.
0	this isn &apos;t as easy as it looks , doesn &apos;t came with enough yellow frosting , and the frosting doesn &apos;t stick very well. my 5 year old did like making it though.
0	drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. the drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. i would not purchase again.
1	i made crab rangoon and used this sauce as a dipping sauce. it was great. i love the fact that it doesn &apos;t have msg in it. it has the right amount of sweetness. it is a little spicy , but just the right amount.
0	two pounds of awful coffee ! my goodness , even instant coffee tastes better. the smell is heavenly , but smells can be deceiving. who knew ? if you want the cocoa aftertaste of the real guatemala antigua coffee , starbucks is your best bet. i can &apos;t wait. try it also ice cold ; it &apos;s out of this world.
1	my baby loves earth &apos;s best product. the food is tasty and doesn &apos;t cause her constipation problem. i &apos;m happy that i can find the organic and affordable food for my baby.
0	first of all , these things taste pretty bad. if you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue , maybe it wouldn &apos;t be as bad. but i really didn &apos;t notice much change in the taste of foods. lemons tasted sweet , but that &apos;s all i noticed. i considered trying two at a time , but they just tasted so bad to me that i have never used them again.
1	this gum is super sick.tatooes are killin.flavor is a spankin &apos; .this brings back bomb diggity memories yo.peace out.
1	the price is very good compared to any retail outlet available to me. came in a simple plastic bag , which i plopped in the freezer. we can pull out a bag , and have fresh treats for our little guy who so richly deserves and loves them.
1	omg these things are delicious ! @ i &apos;m not a candy / sweets eater usually .. but ... ohman ! i liked them so much i may have had , two .. oops , now three !
1	yuban is a smooth , rich tasting coffee. unable to purchase this product in the retail stores in the chicago area. the price of the coffee is very reasonable. the twelve ounce cans keep the coffee fresh. i am very pleased with this product and will purchase it through amazon again when i run out of yuban.
0	read your labels , people ! ! ! smart bones are made in china ! ! ! ! ! ! a neighbor told me how great these were. after buying them , i read the fine print in the back. &quot; made in china ! ! &quot;
1	we like the much harder to find &quot; white &quot; popcorn over the more common &quot; yellow &quot; popcorn and amish country baby white is our absolute favorite. we usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags &apos; cause we go thru it so quickly.
1	why is this $ &#91; ... &#93; when the same product is available for $ &#91; ... &#93; here ? http : / / www.amazon.com / victor-fly-magnet-bait-refill / dp / b00004rbdy the victor m380 and m502 traps are unreal , of course -- total fly genocide. pretty stinky , but only right nearby.
1	the price is wonderful ! the hot cocoa tastes great in 6 and 8 oz but 10oz was a bit watery to me. dark chocolate : yum milk chocolate : is very yummy peppermint : for me wasn &apos;t enough peppermint but i just add a candy cane to mine. i would recommend this again and plan on ordering more soon !
0	i should have read the ingredients list before purchasing this - they are not plain roasted walnuts or tasty roasted walnuts. i did not care for them at all. strange combination of sugar and garlic coating.
1	amazon &apos;s price may be higher than some grocery stores , but it isn &apos;t in my store so this is a good way to shop. i first tried this on a princess cruise ship. i found it is very good and filling. it stays with me , which is very important. i am super please to find this !
0	where &apos;s the ingredient list for this product ? thought all foods were supposed to have it. would never buy any food without first knowing what &apos;s in it !
0	my son loves all of the happy baby meals he &apos;s tried except for this one. he literally gagged. i think it was the use of peppers in the recipe , as he &apos;s not been exposed to peppers yet. he is clearly not a fan so be careful if your child hasn &apos;t tried peppers yet ... they may not like this one.
0	i am the biggest fan of mushrooms you &apos;ll ever meet , but these are really disgusting. they taste like dirt. i have to imagine better quality truffles ( if these are even truffles at all ) are muuuuch better. they &apos;d have to be. there &apos;d be no comparison. these are really bad.
0	the people who make this have no taste buds. this does not taste like berry flavored anything. nor any actual berries i have ever eaten. it tastes horrible. i have had some other flavors and they are fine. but this one is pretty bad. no one i have give none too ( likes the taste of it either.
0	i got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. i would like to no if there is an reimburse.
0	this gf bread mix was not my favorite. i prefer gf pantry. pamelas was really dense and tasted like bisquits not white bread. gf pantry had all the attributes of white bread , unlike pamelas , first it was actually white , it &apos;s fluffy and it tastes like white bread. so anyway i will be buying gf pantry from here on.
1	my dogs love these and even my allergy dogs can eat them too ! ! thanks for have these on your site again 5 stars ! and paws up for old mother hubbard &amp; wellness treats thanks pepper love
1	i am from colombia and i was looking for a coffee that tasted like back home. everyday when i make coffee and the aroma is in the whole kitchen .. it feels like home and it tastes just like it. i love this coffee.
1	wow what a deal. these taste just as good as the expensive brands. most definately will be buying these again.
0	i was able to salvage 9 cans , the remaining 3 cans were open , spilling their contents all over the package. i should have paid more attention to the package , it was literally dripping ...
0	the lids are impossible to secure. this purchase was a complete waste of money. product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured.
0	i was totally disappointed with this coffee , i did not listen to few reviews that already mentioned this is crap. if you are looking for good coffee , this is not it. that &apos;s all. moreover , you cannot return this item ! !
1	anyone who knows yaucono will like the &quot; new &quot; packaging of mylar-laminated plastic. i wonder how long they packaged in layers of paper ? if you have not had this very rich puerto rican coffee , you must sample it and then buy in bulk. juan valdez might have a good bean , but the puerto ricans do it better.
0	if you want the best wild rice , buy the regular kind. this &quot; quick cook &quot; type is not near the taste quality of the regular / 40 minute cook time rice. ,
0	dogs got them as an alternative to beef bones which they are allergic to. they got right into them , but you must supervise as the knobby ends break off and they are about the size of a large marble so could cause some trouble. i also noticed they splintered , so they were removed at that point. i like the idea , but the safety issue was a problem.
1	this is the real deal. genmai cha. loose green tea and roasted brown rice. not in bags. originally known as the &quot; peoples tea &quot; for those who couldn &apos;t afford better. very popular because of its mild flavor. you can drink it all day long ( like i do ) . you won &apos;t be disappointed.
0	i ordered this one and the salmon but i got two salmon instead. i bet this one would be good if i ever got it.
1	i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other. most have too much sugar or worst , corn syrup. this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty. it does have a little kick. enjoy.
1	the best canned clam chowder i &apos;ve found currently available. very light , nicely seasoned , creamy taste. not fishy or oniony. good amount of minced clams per serving. to find better chowder , it would have to be homemade.
0	stevita stevias have a bitter aftertaste and are not as sweet as the sweet leaf brand. the sale price was great , but the product was not worth it.
1	this product saves me money since i can use a regular brand that i like in these kcups and i can still have the kcup convenience of making one drink at a time without using nasty instant coffee. great product !
1	you cant go wrong with rosa monte especial ! this is one of the best yerbas in argentina. go for it. seller did everything ok , in time and etc. !
1	great tasting tea i have been looking for a good sassafras tea forever.finally. i will be ordering this product again . thanks kim : d
1	when i purchased the harmony farms healthy weight formula , i had a mini dachshund and jack russel terrier. both of them love it. i have added a shih tzu to my pack and she loves it , also. i would highly recommend it to others. the kibble is just the right size for small dogs.
1	for whatever reason the only 2 grocery stores where i live no longer carry this product. it is my husbands absolute favorite. i am so glad i am still able to buy this product on line.
1	these are so tasty i use them when making my cheesecake cookies and in pancakes there &apos;s nothing that they can &apos;t be used in. they taste sweet and not overpowering.
1	my children will only eat healthy products , and they love these graham crackers. i am so glad that they are available through amazon !
1	very pleased this stuff smells so good. my roommies love to sniff the shower after ive been in there. the first one got lost in the mail but customer service sent me a second one and upgraded to overnight delivery. so it gets 5 stars from me.
1	these cups are simple and easy to use the only drawback is the fact that maybe 1 / 3 of the cups get caught in the unit when you open. however , they are easy to remove once you just close and reopen.
0	this wolfgang puck coffee jamaica me crazy is the worst coffee i &apos;ve ever had ! i threw it out right away after one sip ! it taste like all coconut flavoring. hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. they should be fired !
0	to be honest , although i &apos;ve always enjoyed anything with paul newman &apos;s name on it and have always reordered things , this time i would not. i really like coffee. this reminded me of instant.
1	i have ordered these a couple times now. they arrive super fresh and sealed every time. i used to buy a roll a day from the gas station , now i have a stash at home that is available anytime. yumm
1	the capsules are easy for my wife to take , they really help her crohn &apos;s disease. after reviewing and reasearching we found that hemp seed oil helps crohn &apos;s disease. she has tried all the prescription meds which if you read the after affects on them they are worse than the crohn &apos;s disease. this product has really helped her from having to many episodes or being sick as often.
0	bubba loved the bone , but was a little dissapointed in the size of the bone. they must have killed some baby pigs to get femurs this small ! bone was about 4 inches long , and not very thick.
1	glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full. it &apos;s hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well. sometimes they are too wide. or too plump with air. bag size is good. bbq flavor is about an 8 out of 10.
0	the box has only pasta and dried-up sauce. no tuna ! ! ! if you can see the words in the spoon on the bottom right of the box , it says , &quot; just add tuna &quot; . so the products is making a false claim ! ! ! shame on you , annie.
1	so fun and great price. this was one of our party favors at my son &apos;s birthday party. huge hit ! i will buy again for the baseball team and group outings. the box is just like the good ol &apos; days , although i remember the prizes were better back then ( or maybe my expectations were lower since i was 10 ) .
1	this was a new food for my dog , and he seems to have adjusted very well to this product. thank you , and i wish there were more coupons available for this item.
1	this mix is the kids &apos; and family favorite. it tastes like vanilla. it &apos;s wonderful for pancakes or waffles.
1	i cannot live without this citron falksalt , it is wonderful on watermelon , fish , almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does. just try it on red juicy watermelon , wonderful experience.
1	childhood nostagia all over again ! i love peanut butter and jelly sandwiches , but i don &apos;t often make them because they &apos;re rather messy. these bars solve that problem-- the oats and stuff provide a perfect compliment to the peanut butter and jelly flavor that &apos;s in the bar. the best part is that i can eat this on the go and not have to worry about my hands or clothes getting messed up.
0	the plant arrived dead. it cost as much to ship. i did not want to hassle with any kind of return. i should know better than to buy a plant on line.
0	it didn &apos;t work for me. maybe its because i couldn &apos;t get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.
1	this hot sauce is one of my favorites. its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. you can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. a mix of garlic , habanero , and other spices. i put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. i highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce.
1	makes perfect , delicious , crisp on the outside and soft on the inside , waffles in minutes. worth every penny !
0	had to buy another box of the same thing at petsmart. she eats those. must not be fresh. how can you tell when they look the same.
0	this detox tea tastes so bad that i had to force it down ! i thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox , but i could hardly get through one box , and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. it also stained my teeth ! i would never take this tea again !
1	this tea smells and tastes like christmas ! this has always been my family &apos;s favorite tea for children &apos;s ( and big kid &apos;s ) tea parties.
1	i love these licorice. get licorice flavor--not just sugar with some flavor. very satisfying.
1	love this for espressos ... the raw sugar cube is not as sweet as the refined sugars and more rich in flavor.
1	can as be used to make cookies - even egg free ! i just used the mix , enough apple sauce to make a batter , some coconut butter and added vanilla and cinnamon and baked. turned out soft delicious cookies with only 5 minutes from box to the oven. however , even wallmart carries this for about one dollar per box less than here.
0	be advised. you will only receive 1 ( one ) box. they are less than $ 3.00 in the local grocery store. will not purchase again.
1	these bean smelled so fresh , they were moist and plump. i &apos;m very impressed with the quality of the beans that were shipped to me. i can &apos;t wait to use them in all of my baked goods !
0	one word , yuk. ok , based on the 20 word minimum ; barely edible dry , chalky , flavorless , not even improved or masked with a good slice of cheddar cheese.
1	we are big fans of the passion fruit tea but wanted to try something different. i like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace , still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though. everyone raves about how good this stuff is. i can &apos;t make enough.
1	i &apos;ve been using this to cook with for over a year. never had a problem with it. love it !
0	my 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. she eats anything. i tried it and so did my husband. it tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. i feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.
0	i was very disappointed with the tug-a-jug. it came in the mail today. the dog had it for 5 minutes and she had the rubber rope chewed in half in that short amount of time. a waste of money for me. i have yet to find something that this black lab doesn &apos;t destroy in record time.
0	we purchased from the original website 8 flavored sugars all but the raspberry was worth the money the rest had little or no flavor at all ! it was expensive and not worth the money.
1	i grew up in southern california , so i &apos;ve had my share of sweet corn cakes at local restaurants. this mix is a great way to make these at home. i prepared a package of these for a friend of mine ( who lives on the east coast and had never tried a corn cake ) .... she &apos;s now addicted but can &apos;t find them at her local store. thank goodness for amazon !
1	if you want to treat your tastebuds to the ultimate delight , try dulce de leche and this brand is the best ! as a native of argentina , i grew up with this stuff and no imitation comes close. serve it inside crepes slightly warm folded and with powder sugar , with flan or ice cream and remember a little goes a long way. very sweet !
0	i completely missed the &quot; blend &quot; note , thinking it was coconut flour. i &apos;m sure many people are looking for the gluten free part , but if you &apos;re looking for lower carb , or non-grain flour ( like a primal diet ) , this won &apos;t work. it has rice flour and potato starch in it - carb city !
1	the absolute best baking product of its kind---i have tried almost all gluten-free baking products and bisquick gluten free is by far the best ! ! ! a little expensive but worth the money ! ! ! ! !
1	being a ride leader with a bicycle club , i use coconut water ( with its high potassium and vitamin c ) as an energy drink. i prefer this product to that you find in ethnic markets , because it has no added sugar and it hasn &apos;t been boiled.
1	halloween is over but , i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.
0	not tasty ... and almost impossible to chew at all ! items are pretty , but seriously , have no taste and are like chewing rubber.
1	i loooove this product .... i use it a lot on my salads , vegetables and to season meats ..... delicious ! ! !
0	kettle chips now look , feel and taste like lays. these chips used to be my favorite when it was crinkle cut and hefty. now , no longer my favorite.
0	i and a friend tried these tablets before sampling various kinds of foods we &apos;d seen suggested online , but noticed no effects whatever. we used them as suggested , then even tried multiple tablets at once. maybe i got a bad batch or maybe we have unusual taste buds , but in any case it was very disappointing. makes me think i should have tried the berries themselves instead.
1	i agree with all who have said that this is a great snack , but i just wanted to say that i piad $ 36.95 for a 4 pack of 30 oz containers from the actual utz site.
1	good quality oats. package came on time. oats worked well in recipes. i will admit , as a single person i bought these oats with my boyfriend for breakfast food- it lasted us for the year. otherwise it &apos;s an excellent buy.
1	what a fresh smell and a very pleasant taste. it , s very good for you too. i use it in place of olive oil , for salads and cooking.
0	taste nothing like how cocoa should taste , i &apos;ll never touch this again , i &apos;ll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck
0	the flavor is decent ( berry vanilla ) , but i just can &apos;t handle the texture. it &apos;s like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it. i &apos;ve been gluten free for about 6 years , and there are much better products out there. my kids won &apos;t even eat these !
0	buyer beware ! the label on the amazon site clearly states &quot; d.o.p certified &quot; but the product received does not match the site label and does not state &quot; d.o.p. certified &quot; this is bait and switch and i will file a complaint with amazon.
1	yummy. good flavor. i wish they were softer and not so crumbly ...... and for some odd reason they give me heartburn , and i never get heartburn. i still like the flavor.
1	i was expecting great things based on the reviews. while it is good , it &apos;s not great. i believe my waffles made from bisquick were just as tasty as these , and this costs quite a bit more. the instructions are very easy to follow though , and i do like the canister for storage.
1	this is an awesome product which i &apos;ve ordered many times. honey-like flavored , lower glycemic sweetener that &apos;s great in coffee or tea.
0	this honey is good. but i can &apos;t understand why the price is changed so frequently. one month ago i bought it at subscribe price 34usd. this time i bought it at subscribe price 40.83usd. but now it is 39.86usd. from the price aspect i don &apos;t recommend it.
0	i used to buy gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. then i discovered that they add gelatin ! why ? it is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value. i will not be buying gerber products again. earth &apos;s best is actually organic.
1	this makes feeding on the go so easy ! my one-year-old will suck down a pouch in 5 minutes and she loves them !
1	i grew up using this seasoning on steak , and pretty much everything. could no longer find it in stores so ordered a case off amazon. very happy nice spice and flavor. highly recommend.
0	i was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale , oregano-like smell. ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves !
0	i don &apos;t care if they &apos;re natural and not fried. the taste is odd and the texture is like packing material.
1	these are better than any low calorie chips i &apos;ve ever had , and i prefer them to normal chips. they are wonderful. oprah even loves them. i would buy this box again , and probably will , because i love that these are 100 calorie packs. the barbeque and salt and vinegar ones are awesome.
1	just right for making dan dan noodles and other delicious recipes. glad to have this in my pantry. flavorful vinegar will be useful for various dishes. product delivery was great - just as expected.
1	i like these chips a lot ! now i have a whole 24 pack ! this is how i get my chips on while i fish !
1	i really enjoyed this drink. the tangerine is very present and makes it very tasty. this drink is 100 % natural and has no sugar added. the carbonation makes it a bit like a soda but a lighter and healthier one. i enjoyed it and i would definitely recommend it to others as an excellent alternative to regular soda.
1	very good coffee. can &apos;t always find it in our local stores , so i order it thru amazon every 3 months
0	somehow i missed the word spice. i wanted peach tea , but this is black tea with clove and orange peel flavoring. i wanted to get off of black tea as it can cause low hemoglobin which is not good for folks who want to donate blood regularly. unfortunately , although this is advertised as peach , it is just black tea.
1	this is the best hot cocoa i &apos;ve had in a k-cup ! the taste is smooth and creamy. it &apos;s perfect for a cold morning or an evening hot drink. i would definitely recommend this product. the best part is that it can be ordered on auto delivery so i never run out.
0	these weren &apos;t great. they have a funny aftertaste. i probably wouldn &apos;t buy them again. texture wise , they were great though.
1	energy bites f &apos;ing rip your face off with molten lava energy. infinity energy to the f &apos;ing max. i ate a whole box once and threw a car at a baby. f &apos;ing rave. seriously these are great.
1	i have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. i have switched them to a different food ( due to price ) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance.
1	the first time i ordered this it came all melted but amazon was quick to remedy the situation by sending me another of the product and it was great thank you
1	oue two labs love these and they are soooo expensive in the pet stores ( $ 4.50 ) each. we got these in bulk for under a dollar each.
1	i love these chips. they are so delicious , it is so hard to eat just one bag. all the flavors allow you to taste them all. my favorite flavor is the cheese ones. go ahead and try them. they are so delicious.
1	these chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful ! the chocolate is very dark and rich and the &quot; bean &quot; inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing.
0	we ordered the product and received 2 broken bottles , but amazon is excellent and reshipped the entire order again one day shipping. unfortunately , even at 85 cents a bottle , we overpaid. there is no cheese taste and it is really just a salty mess. now we have 10 bottles of a below average product. save your money.
0	i thought this toy would be amazingly stimulating. if you look at the top of the bottle , it is nearly impossible for a dog to get the treat out. i wanted a toy that would engage and keep my cojack busy .. she can &apos;t get the treats out. please fix the design ! !
1	one of my favorite restaurants serves this tea iced. they were kind enough to share the brand name with me when i asked. it makes wonderful , refreshing and healthful iced tea. highly recommend.
0	amazon outside packaging arrived in great shape ! unfortunately downhill from there. carton containing creamers was damaged ; original box seal was taped over ( re-sealed previously opened ? ) ; use by date on outside of box indicated 4 months ( typically these have at least 12 months , usually 18 ) . sent feedback to amazon several days ago. apparently fell on deaf ears ( i.e. , no response from amazon ) .
1	and they are good for them ! with whole wheat flower and no high fructose corn syrup like a lot of other crackers.
0	i purchased these because of the low salt , and they were indeed low in salt. however , many , many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. i have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. it was very unappetizing , and who wants all that oil ? i will never buy these again , and i would not recommend them to others.
0	this coffee brews very weak - like a light roast. w.p. chef &apos;s reserve pods are just over half full. put pod on scale and it &apos;s 15 % less coffee wgt than normal pods. stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.
0	i usually do not feel mislead by reviews but this is one of the few. this is very mediocre cocoa powder but nothing mediocre about the premium price. not the worst thing i have had but will never get it again.
1	i am enjoying this tea and the price was reasonable. i don &apos;t think the rose flavor is as pronounced as my favorite rose tea , but since i can not get that one at this time , i ordered this one , and it is very good.
0	yuck , these do not taste good and they are quite tough. better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired.
1	my brother robert that he has purchased this exact product in this size from local indian grocers in houston tx and in austin tx area , including one purchase at a walmart store in an area with significant indian populations. the tea was reported to be a wonderful product for iced tea with a faint pleasant flowery aftertaste. he will purchase it again and again
1	i &apos;m usually a caffeine guy , but i had to switch to decaf while my wife is pregnant. this is definitely the best decaf out there - full flavored , smooth , and very aromatic. it &apos;s the best !
1	i enjoyed the carbonation with a hint of blackberry and liked the fact there are no calories or artificial sweeteners.
1	my baby is 8 months and i purchased the gourmet meals pack. she really liked this one best out of all of them.
0	tasty , small kernel popcorn. however , too small and too light to be popped in a hot air popcorn popper. the kernels are blown out of the popper before they are popped.
0	this product arrived and i was happy , love izze &apos;s , however , what i thought i was getting was four , 4-pks of 12-oz sparkling juice , not the one 4-pk. if that was the case , i could &apos;ve went to my local store and picked-up the case for $ 5 ! this is definitely going back , talk about inflation : - &#124;
1	i find that this jar product works better for people without as much dexterity in their hands ; vs using / opening sweetener packets. this product works well both in cold &amp; hot things like homemade lemonade &amp; in coffee. easy to open lid. product dissolves more easily in cold liquids , than many other types of stevia.
1	i was truly amazed at how great this product is. the flavor is everything that you can expect from a sweetner that is this pure ! i will be ordering it again and i will try the other flavors as well !
1	if you like a lot of flavor in each bite , this is it. a little messy to handle but worth the fuss ! ! !
1	it was a sad moment when i was unable to find my favorite cereal in the grocery stores. i &apos;m not sure why it disappeared , but am so grateful i &apos;m able to purchace this online. thanks !
0	jelly did not set well and as a result is almost liquid. taste is not that of strawberry. do not recommend purchase.
0	i ordered this over a month ago and have not received the product and have not received an answer from the company as to why i did not get the product. buyer beware ! ! ! over $ 40 down the tubes !
1	i think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week.
0	they have some textured powder stuff on them that makes them taste bad .. bad after taste. i guess it &apos;s so they don &apos;t stick together. never again
1	i have been using g / f products for the past 4 years and it is good to see more main stream companies getting the religion. the product works , the pancakes and waffles have come out beautifully.
0	this mix is just not that good. very runny and the taste is horrible. i do not recommened this.
1	best coffee ever. still haven &apos;t found anything i like better. i have never tasted coffee this strong that wasn &apos;t bitter at all. kind of pricey when you start working out what it is costing you per pound but cheaper than buying directly from gevalia. if this company started opening stores , starbucks and their bitter brews would go bye bye.
0	there were maggots in the box on arrival. such a great surprise when i went to prepare lunch for my three year old.
0	while i admit that the oversalted chip is addictive , i really think this one has gone too far. skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. i am surprised that they are still on the market.
0	i prefer my chicken cooked on a grill or pan fried. well , i tried shake n &apos; bake for the first time and thought it was just okay in the taste dept. not asying it was bad , i just was not my cup of tea. i &apos;ll be sticking with my trusty grill or frying pan next time i wan &apos;t some chicken.
1	these treats are the only ones my 14 year old dog will eat. she loves them.
1	this is our second time using your black winter truffles .... they are truly delicious. we throw them in with pasta and truffle oil to have the world &apos;s best dish ... reminds of our stay in tuscany. this is a quality product and we plan on buying again in the near future.
0	we have a year old pug who will eat just about anything but these ! unfortunately he just would not go near them no matter how hard we tried to peak his interest.
0	inexpensive little mat. but it &apos;s so small and doesn &apos;t help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. and like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didn &apos;t even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. it needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag.
0	i found this canned pumpkin kind of bland and it needs extra spices to boost the flavor of it.
1	this product has worked since the first day i have had it. tremendous buy for me. i needed my mic to go directly into the computer. thanks.
1	much better than having to fight removing coffee grinds from a metal basket. i love being able to just toss grinds into the trash.
0	when a product is past its &quot; best by &quot; date , that fact should be revealed so we can decide whether to risk it. these were stale , hard , inedible caramels.
0	for the uninitiated , &apos; evaporated cane juice &apos; is just sugar by another name. another product that tries to present itself as healthy , but isn &apos;t really ... eating something that lists sugar as the second ingredient isn &apos;t what i would consider to be a healthy start for the day.
0	this coffee is great , don &apos;t buy it here , though. your local grocery store will have it for much less and your local sam &apos;s club will have it for less than $ 13.
1	this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup , the best i have ever eaten , with large hearty chunks of chicken , and vegetables and nice large noodles. this soup is just so full bodied , and is seasoned just right. i am so glad amazon carries this product. i just can &apos;t find it here in vermont.
1	this product is exactly as described. i use my keurig brewer daily and now i am able to use my choice of coffee. they are simple to use and work great. the delivery from liquibuy , llc on amazon was prompt and packaged perfectly.
0	the bottles were both leaking badly ; about half the product had leaked through the bottom of the box. unfortunately they cannot be returned , so i just wasted money ordering this.
0	really amazon ? ! nothing says delicious summer treat to me like a nice cup of egg nog ... and when i am not craving egg nog in the summer , it &apos;s gingerbread i &apos;d really like ... don &apos;t buy this , it sucks ... i &apos;m probably just going to toss it. if there was the ability to rate this with a negative number ... i &apos;d say -3
1	this jerky is the bomb ! ! ! it is by fare the best i have ever had and i have had a lot of jerky in my day.
0	don &apos;t know much to say except they smelled funny upon opening the bag and neither of our 2 dogs would go anywhere near them.
1	i , like most people , switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods , settled on this one. my dogs like it and i feel good about it feeding it to them.
1	its my daughter &apos;s favorite first and foremost. for me i love that i can get lentils , there aren &apos;t many stage 2 or 3 vegetarian choices.
0	i don &apos;t know what kind of coffee these people giving this stuff 5 stars were drinking but this coffee honestly tastes like the beans were roasted to the point of charcoal. out of 54 people that i work with , only two like it. i think somebody is getting paid to give this stuff a good review.
1	this was a gift from my lil sis. awesome. great flavor. can taste berries and rhubarb. i love it. most likely will order more.
0	ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. normal amazon shipping etc ... the cigars were cracked and stale. how does chewing gum shatter and break ? no way it was fit for consumption. easy return process.
0	on top of the delightful aspartame , this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for country time lemonade mix.
1	super tasty quick meal. it &apos;s a bit small , but perfect for a lunch on the go. definitely not going to help you with any dinner hunger pangs though. the sodium is a little higher than i &apos;d like , but i really can &apos;t beat it for economic and efficient lunchfood.
0	this is for puppies the bag is super small ! ! ! the bag didn &apos;t last more than a day. i thought it was funny when i got the bag i thought it was a gift to be honest ! ! !
1	these crackers are a great healthy snack without anything spread on them. my only dislike is that they are a tad too sweet for me. i &apos;d like them without the molasses.
0	the product is of excellent quality and of great taste and is imported from india. unlike most of the items available in amazon.com , this one is overtly priced @ $ 23.99 when you can get it only at $ 8.99 in local grocery shops.
1	the product was exactly as i expected and the same as previously bought in retail stores.
1	like i said about the icing .... i am so happy to be able to buy this online. it is a family favorite , it also was shipped on time and arrived early. definitely going to buy again.
0	i really wish my toddler liked this. it seems to be very high quality and it would provide more variety in his diet. every so often he &apos;ll eat it , but it usually needs to be mixed with something else. i think it tastes fine , but it wasn &apos;t a hit. i bought a case so i keep trying.
0	the candy is just red , no flavor . just plan and chewy . i would never buy them again
1	everyone loves pocky and if they say they don &apos;t they are lying lol. the pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.
1	i received all the ingredients in a timely manner. all the ingredients were nicely packed and remained fresh through the shipping stages. it was more than i needed for the meal i was making , so i had plenty of left over ingredients.
0	this is a really good product but not a great price. shop-rite &apos;s normal price is the same as the subscribe and save price. they however have it on special offer so it is cheaper still , yet you don &apos;t have to buy 16 at once.
0	i have purchase a number of products from jack links and have been generally pleased. this item however was awful. it was old and mouldy. could not eat them.
1	excellent in cereal , or on top icecream sundae. i use them in my ramen noodle hot / sour soup as well. very very good. almost a lite peanut flavor. not too much salt , very lightly seasoned. a must try for anyone wanting a low calorie addition of protien into diet. even the dog loves them. thinks they are some special treat.
1	these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap. the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store. i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies. we ate them all !
1	i love the metallic and sheen colors. in a photo , the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real. the sheen really kicks the color up a notch.
1	it is hot ! i love it , tasty and a little sweet. i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot , but this one lives up to its billing.
1	this is the first time i have found a us produced truffle oil that actually contains real truffle. a lot of other &quot; truffle oils &quot; just have &quot; truffle aroma &quot; ( whatever that is ) and a lot of chemicals that sound less than pleasant. you can definitely taste the difference as well.
1	great price and my cat loves this food. he has been on it for 9 years. my vet says he is the healthest cat he sees.
0	i am gf and appreciate any / all efforts towards new foods but this is dull stuff. making your own granola is super easy and takes very little effort. i &apos;ll take my $ 6 for this weenie package and head back to the kitchen.
1	i started using nustevia several years ago. back then i had to purchase it from a health food store. thanks to amazon i can now order and have it within a few days. i never run out ! as for the product , it &apos;s the best. i &apos;ve tried several stevia products but they have an after taste. not with nustevia. please try if you haven &apos;t.
0	i agree the jerky is way too salty and it has an unusual flavor. the package says hickory , but i have no idea what it is. i will try another brand next time.
1	i was browsing around on amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. i will just order and have shipped to my friends. habanero is my favorite , i love the heat and the tangy spiciness. i also love the pineapple. you will not go wrong ordering this up.
0	i hated this k-cup and couldn &apos;t wait to be done with the box. ( we hate wasting unless toxic. ) so while not toxic , the best i can say for this variety is that it tastes like bitter , yet weak &quot; sock water &quot; . now , after reading the many good reviews this blend has received , i &apos;m apprehensive to trust the reviews of the other k-cup varieties.
0	i can &apos;t believe i didn &apos;t check out the ingredients for this. i never would have bought it if i would have known there was artificial sweetener in it ! first cup though , i got that weird after taste it gives and that was all she wrote. if you don &apos;t have a problem with a chemical taste or concerns about health problems , you may like it. not worth it to us.
0	for some reason talking rain got yuppie , and changed the bottle from a short squat version , to a tall version that falls over. i used to buy these and would again if they brought back the old bottle.
0	i read all the reviews before purchasing. just received the mini sprouter tried to start using but the water keeps leaking out the sides. not sure what i could be doing wrong since its only 7 pieces that stack. very disappointing ! returning this asap ! !
0	after i purchased this for a gift , i was told that the enclosed cold pack had melted. soggy peppermint patties weren &apos;t the treats that i had intended to send.
1	this product is excellent. it &apos;s also a nut snack that my wife , who has celiac disease , and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy. i however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack i &apos;ve ever tried. al &amp; virginia weatherly 53996 luzerne dr. macomb , mi 48042
0	popcorn has grear color ( white ) but taste is average and due to shipping costing more then product , i would not buy again.
1	this filters are perfect to use with the extra ground coffee i have.they are as good or better than the k-cups.
0	medaglia d &apos;oro has to be the worst coffee i &apos;ve ever had. it had an old musty flavor and odor. you get what pay for.
1	i love this product cant find it locally. sometimes little out of the way stores have it.but i also love the chicken , pork chop bags.every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market.
0	this was gross. it lamb lund &amp; smelled bad. there hard chips. my dogs favorite is the texas taffy. thats a winner. i cut it into peices. she loves them.
1	i had never heard of this coffee before but i got a bag and really liked it. this melitta cafe riviera sunset decaf is a very good decaf with a good taste and body. this stuff is perfect for a late-night cup of coffee or for a cup with some dessert. its decently priced and i will definitely buy this again.
0	popcorn tastes old , and if you use the entire salt contents your popcorn is horribly salty. i thought it was just me but everyone who has tried it thought the same.
0	once again , paragon has disappointed with this flavor. the hawaiian tropic , simply did not carry much flavor , and what you could taste was not pleasant at all. i do not recommend this syrup concentrate.
1	grandpa po &apos;s originals scored big on our party &apos;s fun factor. these half-baked nuggets of organic popcorn blended with dry-roasted soybeans were a surprise hit with both kids and adults. our young nibblers approached this snack with a quizzical , &quot; what is this ? caution. but once tasted , the bowl was quickly emptied and our partygoers were eager for a refill. grandpa po &apos;s come in slightly unsalted and slightly spicy.
1	this is the pancake mix we go to when we don &apos;t have buttermilk in the fridge ( don &apos;t think the vinegar trick is worth it so we always do fresh ) to make alton brown &apos;s buttermilk pancake recipe. this stonewall mix is a good option and the flavor is the best of any store bought mix by far ! it might cost more , but it really is superior to the other prepared mixes.
1	this is a great product for us gluten free people. we use it for everything .... from pancakes , waffles , to cookies , scones , cooking.
0	i have purchased these in the past and enjoyed them. this whole box is old. the flavor is off badly.
1	great value if you buy it as a subscribe and save item , and i love that it automatically comes to me. these are great and they taste really good , making me think that we bought a very high quality product for our child.
1	my dog loves this food , and she has maintained her healthy weight for many years. the vet is very happy with her general health , coat , and teeth. having the 16lb bag sent directly to my home without any shipping charges is terrific ! the 16 lb. size is not available in my area.
0	sent this to my mother to help her out with groceries since she is on a fixed income. she said it was horrible and would be throwing the other 2 boxes out. so i would not reccomend this product.
0	i don &apos;t see how there can be good quality salmon in this or lentils ..... it is mostly potato and pollack ( substitute cheap fish ) --- this is really terrible for organic baby food - ugh , if i only had a cat to feed it to ....
0	this oatmeal is not good. its mushy , soft , i don &apos;t like it. quaker oats is the way to go.
1	sleepytime tea is one of those teas that can always be counted on. it &apos;s very mellow , with a great taste and smell. perfect for relaxing after a long day. this is the tea that all other herbal teas should be measured against.
1	this is a great product ! hats off to betty crocker once again. they are becoming a more &quot; main stream &quot; go-to company for people who are gluten free !
1	i threw my son a baseball themed party for his 1st birthday. what would baseball be without popcorn , peanuts &amp; get crackerjack ? ! item was delivered as promised &amp; the packaging was old school , which was appreciated by parents , granparents &amp; the even great grandparents ! item was fresh &amp; taste great !
0	i ordered this coffee and another brand , it seems , about three weeks ago. i checked this morning , february 8 , and found the deliver is out into march or apri. i paid for the product soon after it was ordered and have been told on checking delivery that it can no longer be canceled. wow ! ! ! ! !
0	it works reasonably well with condenser microphones. with dynamics the hum exceeds the signal. works with windows , not with linux. the build is very cheap. anything more than $ 5 for this is too much.
1	great coffee--this was way too much to pay for it , but i could not find it anywhere else at the time. i feel a taken advantage of price-wise and probably would not order again.
0	my kids loves chips ahoy ! and i will have them once in a while as well. but the kids refuse to eat them from this family size package. once i tasted them , i knew why. they have an awful medicinal taste. really bad. i don &apos;t what the problem is , but if you like chips ahoy , you will not like these. go elsewhere.
0	we tried this brand based on decent reviews &amp; price but were unhappy with the texture ; the popcorn is very tough. i will likely donate or toss.
0	the spaces are interconnected under the blue top , hard sharp edges inside and on the mobile lining ; and the dogs have a hard time getting to the food. my little guy actually yelped , i suppose he got his tongue caught. he did not go back to &apos; negative reinforcement .... &apos; not a good invention ..........
0	its not that this coffee sucks its that it doesn &apos;t begin to measure up to all the hoopla ! its well balanced but thats about it &amp; even a little old tasting nothing special in the least what sweet caramel finish ? can &apos;t believe this is the same coffee the 5 star reviews are about
1	i &apos;ve tried a few different hot cocoa brands for my keurig ... and have been disappointed every time , until now ! cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium ! i add a splash of almond milk and i &apos;m ready to go : ) perfect ! i &apos;ll definitely buy this again.
1	these little gems are only 20 calories each and almost fat free , and taste way better than a rice cake , imho. i &apos;m glad they come in packs of 10 boxes because otherwise the husband and kids would eat them all and there &apos;d be none left for me !
0	love these kcups. box said &quot; 80 &quot; but contained only 35. please send me the missing 45 kcups newmans own special.
1	i had bought small cans previously and they arrived inadequately packaged , so they all had tiny dents. these , however , arrived undented , well-packaged in bubble wrap. i have not yet opened them , but i have used the small cans. this oil is great quality , and the price is not overblown. recommended.
1	mccann &apos;s oatmeal is a good quality choice. our favorite is the apples and cinnamon , but we find that none of these are overly sugary. for a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes , this is excellent.
1	i used the bisquick pancake and baking gf mix to make snickerdoodle cookies. they were very good and stayed fresh for some time. thank you for offering this mix.
0	it fits the right ball and it is just as &quot; everlasting &quot; as the other disks , but i really don &apos;t think this smells at all like vanilla or mint.
0	tastes - burnt , roasted , slightly rotten sunflower seed taste ; gritty , bland - no salt , sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free. &quot;
1	since being gluten free i &apos;ve tried all types of gf breads and they are all very expensive. who knew that the brazilians had the bread game on lock with this inexpensive tapioca version of cheese bread ! it &apos;s custom which is probably why they are all so skinny ! lol but i loved it and will be ordering a whole lot more !
1	i really enjoyed this drink ! i am a lover of both orange juice and sunkist type drinks so i was very eager to try this drink. it is the perfect combination of sweet and fruity ! ! ! the tangerine i believe helps give the extra lift of the sweet taste. if you &apos;re trying to cut back on pop , i highly recommend this drink or even just for a refreshing treat !
1	these are a great snack for any dog who has food allergies to chicken. my 20 pound sheltie loves them more than any other chew or rawhide that we have given her. i highly recommend these for any dog , especially one with food allergies.
0	i usually order bustelo decaffeinated coffee and i am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. i tried this lavazza decaf espresso and i am extremely disappointed. it &apos;s really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. i ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that i haven &apos;t opened yet if i can do that ...
1	walnut oil is an essential ingredient in our favorite waffle batter. this oil is the best we &apos;ve used for the price. great aroma ! ! !
1	the walnut oil is really good. i later will often come to buy it.i hope you will like it too.
0	this listing sells the freezer tray for nearly $ 50 when all other retailers sell for 19.95. make sure you look before you buy.
0	not good coffee at all - i thought i was buying the donut shop decaf ( which is awesome ) but thought ill give it a try instaed of shipping it back ... it has a terrible chemically / stale type aftertaste. donut shop is way better.
1	i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat , and this is an excellent food. that is also according to my holistic veterinarian. they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step , which is very important to me. the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select.
0	i had hoped that this would still have a rich flavor without an acidic burn , but it just tasted bland , old , and stale. i actually couldn &apos;t drink an entire cup and threw out the rest of the package i got as a vine member. i typically prefer a rich , strong flavor but often bold coffees have too much acid. this had no richness or flavor.
1	this is really great hot chocolate. the price is right too. usually i find that hot chocolate k-cups are weak or watery but not this one. i was impressed. the dark chocolate is really yummy ! i will be ordering more.
0	i &apos;ve tried a lot of different k-cups and this is the weakest k-cup coffee i &apos;ve ever tried. it should not be labeled &quot; medium roast &quot; , it should be labeled &quot; warm water tasteless &quot; roast. too bad i bought a large box. what a waste ...
1	these chips are perfect for snacking with or without salsa. the texture is brittle and thin , like other plocky &apos;s chips. the only downside : the spice is minimal.
1	got this for my brother who is on jorge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself. it actually tastes pretty good.
1	this is a hefty roll of mylar ! the 50 &quot; width allows more coverage , obviously , but the 1 ml thickness is what &apos;s really nice. it &apos;s not flimsy !
0	totally not worth paying for. even my kids hated this stuff. very cheap cocoa in tiny tiny tins for too much money. i could have gone out and bought twice as much swiss miss , and enjoyed that a whole lot more.
0	wolfgang puck &apos;s &quot; breakfast in bed &quot; is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one.
1	if you like goat cheese and smoked cheeses you will love this. it has a very smokey creamy flavor. try it spread on crackers with a little black truffle oil.
0	the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed , considering on the blue website it says that it is. i gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product , but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. most likely wont be buying anything else from blue
1	i was born and raised on the east coast trenton - new jersey ) . i have loved tasty-kakes my whole life , so its a great present to find some mew flavors or twists on old familiar receipes.
0	sorry , i saw absolutely no benefit in taking this product. i never felt better or worse. lost or gained weight. it took it for several months and quit because it obviously wasn &apos;t doing anything.
0	don &apos;t you know that sugar is the sand of time ? since the ingredients of kavli crispy thin were listed on amazon , and the time i received my order , sugar was added to this product. you are going to get in trouble , mister.
1	i &apos;ve been enjoying this tea for years. this tea is good mornings , afternoons or evenings. my local store went out of buisiness .... thanks amazon ! i use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot.
0	i think this chunky chili is the worst store-bought chili. the meat has the texture of artificial soybean meat and is chewy , the sauce is too sweet and cloy. this has no character. i prefer hormel or dennisons to this. by far.
0	this soup is very very sweet. they left out the salt but it is full of sugar. there is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can. too sweet for me. also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies.
1	these baby gummy bears are by far the best i &apos;ve ever had. i had first purchased the 1.5 lb bag here , on amazon , but i realized as soon as it arrived that it wasn &apos;t going to be enough. however 5 lbs on a subscription basis ? oh yeah.
1	these are great tasting and have good consistency and meatiness. easy to eat on the run ( no mess ) .
1	in my book. you can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. just wish that there were more bbq and cheese flavored selections. the black pepper is the bestest yet.
0	despite what the previous , obviously fake reviews claim this product doesn &apos;t do anything to prevent hangovers. drink water instead and save yourself $ 24. no such thing as &quot; toxins &quot; . psuedoscientific snake oil.
1	for some reason they stopped selling this in stores in fort worth. this is my favorite for chicken.
0	not one member of my family , including me , like these extremely salty , much too strong a bq taste to order more. i purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now. i have received only one shipment. cancel further shipments. not to our taste at all. these are lowery pork rinds.
0	there is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel ! ! ! why would you put cancer in your food ?
0	while taste is ok it &apos;s simply using too many artificial colors ( blue1 , red 40 , yellow 5 , yellow 6 - approved by fda doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s healthy ) and other chemicals ( bht etc ) to be used by children. if you &apos;re going to eat it yourself - take your chances. but since there are many good and healthy alternatives - why bother ?
0	&quot; yeast extract &quot; is listed as an ingredient. sounds harmless , right ? specifically , these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract , which is , on a chemical level , monosodium glutamate. it &apos;s just derived from a different source , but it has all the same toxic properties. kettle still advertises their products as containing &quot; no msg &quot; while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with msg sensitivities.
0	bought this under the influence of many positive reviews. i &apos;m sorry to say that i found this produce upalatable , unacceptable. it manages to be both insipid and bitter , leaves a nasty aftertaste , and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. i &apos;m returning it right away.
1	my whole family loves these &quot; chips &quot; . i am following the weight watchers plan and the whole bag is only 3 points , there is quite a few in the bag totally worth it ! ! !
0	only three jars came in a form edible to babies. the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy mush that would not mix with the water. it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the jars that had the good mixture. pretty disappointing and a waste of money.
1	i purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with jungle theme ! they worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. i purchased 5 # . if you want more than 25 small bags , i would purchase a larger bag.
0	so when you purchase beans of a reputable brand you would expect to get fresh beans. they tasted old from the opening of the bag and so even if the date was well in advance of it &apos;s expiration i can only surmise that quality control was an issue in the storage or shipping of the beans. but i won &apos;t be ordering any more espresso beans from this company unless they can correct this.
1	my husband loves pudding and any kind of dessert at the end of dinner. this is a great way to appease his cravings while not being full of butter and fat. i love that i can add whatever i want to it to fancy it up a little. i love to put cocoa powder and make a more elegant tasting chocolate pudding or mix it with berries for my kids.
1	i can no longer find yuban on the grocery shelfs.it is by far the best coffee delicious flavor and no acid i would highly recommend yuban
1	i love getting this case. it actually saved me money by buying it this way ... and my son loved the fruit varieties. i felt good about giving him this , because it is organic. the price is also good for the product.
0	my dog will happily eat sorel boots , pens , old work gloves , and any paper product but chewed on one of these treats for a couple seconds and just left it sitting on the floor. this is the first time i &apos;ve ever given her something to eat that she didn &apos;t basically inhale. how do you eff up making a dog treat ?
0	i ordered this from amazon and they were pure liquid. like water. i did not feel at all comfortable feeding them to my daughter. amazon customer service , however , was awesome and gave me a full refund
1	enjoyed the product and they also provided very fast shipping. i &apos;m about out and need to order more.
0	way too sweet. 2 or 3 is all i can manage in one go. make sure you try a small pack before buying the 5 pound bag ! ! !
1	i prefer to sweeten my own tea and so this is perfect. it makes a strong cup of iced tea , and some may choose to add more water after brewing. easy to make and great to have around. taste is very good.
1	awesome ! i was looking for this particular plant and homedepot / lowes / walmart didnt have any , i ordered it online a little reluctant - my first even plant purchase online , but it is doing great so far ! i am happy !
1	these chips are delectably delicious. i am on a low sodium diet. i didn &apos;t have to give up totally something that i truely love to snack. these chips are bursting with flavor , and you can &apos;t really tell they are missing all that salt. there is just a kiss worth on a chip , but beleive me , it is a total makeout ! ! !
0	my one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic. two weeks later i gave him a large helping of these and i thought he was going to die. he laid around and would not eat or move for two days. i will not feed him these again. same thing happened to my parent &apos;s cat after eating the salmon variety.
1	they &apos;re perfect training treats for my dogs. they go to the place where they &apos;re stored and stand there until i get a handful for our play games.
1	let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more. i have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste i recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky .. a + + + + + + + + + + + +
1	i love this coffee but i am not sure what has happened to the price lately i used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $ 40. i am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
0	i was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. tastes like a glorified version of mrs. dash and far from salt flavor. if you want something really good try himalayan pink salt sold through amazon --- it &apos;s outstanding ! ! ! ! i purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. yum , real salt but good for you.
0	the pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores. it is not available in all stores , but i have found it conveniently enough for my purposes.
1	good value for the money. these are good. the hot cocoa is excellent however , don &apos;t get the coffee cuz its instant !
1	i was expecting hard tasteless healthy cookies. it is soft , a little chewy and yummy. very tasty.
0	i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for 99c. the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake. it stuck to the knife , ran down in strings , what a mess. i too thought i had gotten a bad batch.my gds birthday cake looks like crap. who would buy this mess. horrible
0	lowrey &apos;s bacon curls pork rinds : 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt , thats all i tasted , a pinch of salt would have been better.
0	the hot chocolate has a weird flavor to it. i will not be buying this product again , and will probably not consider any more green mountain products.
1	this sauce is something of a permanent staple on our table ! ! just about everything gets a dash or two , or three !
1	my wife uses this and she has no complains. it makes her smell nice and clean and it foams well. great moisturizer inside. i personally don &apos;t care for it because it feels slimy on my skin after use. i guess that is the moisturizer working. very good smell though.
1	this is a very good , medium-roast , medium-bodied coffee. brew it directly after grinding the bean to capture the most flavor.
1	arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix. it tastes great , cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make. although it can be made using water , i think it &apos;s better made with milk. i love it with pure organic maple syrup.
0	it didn &apos;t remove the spots ... now what am i going to do with all of the sponges i bought ?
1	what can i say ? ? they are wonderful , and the highlight of each weekend. ohhhhhh - use soda water for the liquid ! even better ! ! !
1	i could smell the vanilla even through the packaging ! there were lots of vanilla beans and they were all in great shape. i &apos;m excited to see how my homemade vanilla extract turns out !
0	we opened a can of bar harbor clam chowder and could not believe how few clams were in the chowder. there were mostly potatoes.
1	it was recently suggested to me i try going gluten-free to battle an autoimmune thyroid disorder. i bought the gluten-free bisquick hoping the pancakes would at least be edible. the bisquick has far exceeded my expectations ! the pancakes are light , fluffy , and delicious ! i definitely recommend this product !
1	wrigleys &apos; 5 flare sugarless gum is wrigleys &apos; sugarless replacement for their &quot; big red &quot; cinnamon gum. 5 flare seems to be difficult to find in stores. thanks to amazon i always have a supply. 5 flare is also the longest lasting gum i have ever experienced both in flavor and durability. it is positively the best cinnamon flavor currently on the market.
1	this is real licorice. it is soft , has great taste , and is very healthy ! love it.
0	to be honest with you , i got these at a store. you think wow chocolate chips , and oreos. think again.for those that think these are so good , i would recommend the hershey &apos;s or reese &apos;s crisp wafer bars. my honest view on these &quot; thin crisps &quot; cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones.
0	wasa crisp &apos;n light inside packaging cannot be recycled. the crackerbread is excellent , but its inside packaging is a cellophane or type of plastic that cannot be recycled anywhere in the six states i have contacted. todate wasa has not revealed what the inside packaging is made of , nor where i can recycle it.
1	excellent product. exactly what they said it would be. superior chamomile from what i have ordered before from other companies. excellent value for the price.
1	this really is the only choice when it comes to soy and dairy free baking ( unless you want to use lard ) . the spectrum shortening uses palm kernel oil and has the consistancy of regular crisco ( perhaps a little stiffer ) . it seems to bake just fine and if you need to be soy and dairy free i highly recommend it.
1	everything about the order went great , the hot chocolate is very good. i will be ordering this again probaly soon.
1	i ordered this after having much success with their liquid products. it is not bitter at all and has a very fresh / clean taste to it. i have baked with it , used it on the stove , and in my oatmeal and hot cocoa. when i run out , i &apos;ll be ordering more !
0	i just purchased these at the 99 cent store. i was very disappointed with the taste : super sweet , very little dark chocolate flavor , not even creamy like milk chocolate ... but .... each to his own , i guess. me , i would rather save my calories for better tasting chocolate.
1	i got a bag with 25 oinkies , pig skin with sweet potato in the middle. but my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received. it &apos;s still made by hartz. the description of this product didn &apos;t say anything about sweet potato in the center. so unless they update the description &amp; package image i got the wrong product. i &apos;m only happy because my doggies are. : p
1	oh so good. the first cup i had was on the medium setting. it was too sweet. so i had my second on the larger setting and it was perfect ! this is a creamy hot chocolate. add a little milk and and whipped cream , and your set ! ! ! !
1	a fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. i bought it for a gift for my brother so i ended up sampling , using them myself. truly flavorful ! and hot ! i use it in my omelets. burritos. nachos. beans.
1	at first i was thinking , &quot; cheese flavored chips ? &quot; but i love them. the herbs they used are just delicious. the cheese is not overpowering. they are yummy and crispy ! !
1	i was disappointed by the fact that all three boxes i received had already expired. luckily enough , the flavors had not yet degraded. i specifically bought these in order to get the peppermint flavor. i was hoping for more. the peppermint hot chocolate does not have much peppermint flavor to it , but we will still enjoy it and both of the other flavors.
1	the potato bread was easy to mix , rises well in my breadmaker , cooks as it should and best of all was very tasty. the bread has a near white bread texture , and was very good. i purchased all of the hodgson mixes and this was one of my favorites.
1	we have used the victor fly bait for 3 seasons. can &apos;t beat it. great product !
0	when i bought this mat i initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didn &apos;t like stepping on it either. because of it &apos; small size , i end up with daily litter on either side of this mat. disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter.
0	this is vile stuff. the ingredients list says the sweetener is inulin , derived from jerusalem artichokes. woof. no other sweetener is listed , but it tastes like three freshman chemistry majors came up with their versions of fake sugar and then dumped them all in.
0	another love it or hate it toy .... it &apos;s a bottle , it &apos;s a spiky ball , it &apos;s a rope , it &apos;s a treat dispenser ! apparently , the choices are too overwhelming for our vizsla puppy because she passes this one up. in addition , the hard plastic bottle makes a racket on our hard kitchen floor , so maybe it &apos;s a blessing after all : )
0	this smells more like cat food. my dogs ate the first can , but i mixed half with their previous food. now they won &apos;t touch it , even by itself.
1	they were not bad tasting ........... they served the purpose that i wantned with a sandwich nice and crunchy
1	makes very good , light waffles. seems to be exactly the same as carbon &apos;s golden malted waffle mix. only this is more expensive.
1	i heard my kids talking about candy they remembered from childhood and they mentioned toffifay , so i checked amazon to see if it was still being sold. it was , and reasonably priced.i ordered a 24 pack , and divided it among their christmas stockings.they were really surprised and happy to find it christmas morning.i &apos;m glad i thought of searching amazon !
1	the taste says fresh-squeezed quality fruit. the carbonation content is lower than some drinks of this variety. this ratio makes for a heavier juice drink. though a delicious treat , especially with breakfast on the deck , i prefer to save a few calories ( 140 per can ) and have more carbonation.
1	we received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up ! great biscuits and now i am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people i can &apos;t figure out what to get ...
1	it is chocolate , what can i say. great variety of everything our family loves. with a family of six it goes fast here. perfect variety. kit kat , reeses , take five and more.
0	i bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. the order said it &apos;d take 5 business days. it ended up taking over 3 weeks
1	the small , white popcorn is the best ! very delicious - and i &apos;ve tried lots.
1	this is my favorite hot sauce ! i liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. i have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.i really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos !
1	i &apos;m italian and i lived in italy for years. i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso. i couldn &apos;t find them anywhere here in the bay area , so it &apos;s great to have them again.
1	very good lemonade mix. close to fresh in taste. love that it has stevia. i like it so much more than crystal light or any of the other mixes with artificial sweeteners. i can take it anywhere , mix it in bottled water , and have a refreshing , healthy , safe , cool drink.
0	this is the very worse bbq suace i have ever tasted and bought. i saw the man v food show which featured the stomach bile tasting thin sauce and then bought it ... wow texas really doesn &apos;t know bbq sauce.
1	i used to take sudafed for my stuffy nose. i tried this tea and felt relief immediately. i usually drink this tea twice a week and have not yet felt the stuffy nose. would highly recommend.
0	i received this product with an expiration date for last april. didn &apos;t work well. the yeast didn &apos;t activate. i am very disappointed with this product.
0	i purchased this for my retriever who &apos;s really active and saw absolutely no change from these tablets. he gets tons of exercise and is still really busy all the time so i figured something like this would calm him down a little bit. no effect whatsoever.
1	this is the best licorice in the usa. if you have a craving for something sweet , this is it. and so good for you. i love it and the price is very reasonable. i will continue to order this product. it is always fresh.
0	expensive , nasty and low in protein ! i really don &apos;t understand how this product has got good reviews. i am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. i drunk it once and the rest i flushed through the toilet. bad !
0	the price is right. organic tea at a great price , but that &apos;s as far as it goes. i &apos;ve tried about 5 of the davidsons so far and they just lack character.
0	the hot chocolate is fine but the price here is crazy. you can get the same thing on the keurig site for under $ 15.
1	i &apos;ve tried many brands of sardines. these are my favorite. even with low sodium , they are full of flavor. excellent choice.
1	great alternative for those who can &apos;t eat wheat. a little bland , but crunchy and crispy.
0	i &apos;m on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly. think it is very good. try their salsa. couple of jars of this &amp; a couple of jars of another pasta suace , spices , seasonings , etc. however , the $ 44.00 + shipping cost is a major rip-off. try one of two or three sites on google. you will save $ 20.00 to $ 30.00 a case.
1	this is my favorite hot sauce. i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy ! my favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce !
1	we have been using this product for over a year now , goldie our dog loves it , she is 15 years old now.
1	my daughter loves them. they are easy to heat up and good for the body and earth. it &apos;s the perfect weekday dinner for us busy mums. and it &apos;s so clean to eat , that &apos;s the key. not as messy as mac n &apos; cheese. thanks peas of mind to make my life easier.
0	i bought this coffee because of mr. newman &apos;s charity. boy , was that a misguided decision. the coffee is bitter , but the worst attribute is its muddy , sludgy mouth feel--which is the hallmark of poor quality beans. i just threw away about $ 35 worth ... words to the wise.
0	used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad. stopped using it &amp; the cats fur is back to fine. back to feeding my cats nature &apos;s variety instinct. i baught this petgaurd product at fairway market not amazon. will not use it again.
1	powdered green tea with lemon &amp; ginger provides quick daily source of antioxidant ingredients desired but in higher concentration and without the bother of brewing tea bags. simply pour in water bottle , shake and be on your way. product used to be available in local health food stores but is no longer carried. much easier and more cost effective when bought in quantity on amazon.
1	got these for my kids as christmas stocking stuffers. they love them. as far as delivery , the product came in good condition , timely , and was terrific. definitely a good buy.
0	they were very salty and seasoned with a seasoning that my family and myself did not like. i shared with co-workers and they did not like them either. we still have the balance and hate to pitch them but if we can not find someone who likes them that we can give them to we will. i think they were awful
1	my whole family loves this product , often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have ( some members of my family have severe nut allergies ) . this product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are.
0	the treats were ok , my main complaint is they were small about the size of a lifesaver.which made it hard to give them to my medium size dog as a treat.one treat just di not do it.this package should be labeled for toy or small dogs.
1	i bought this gift pack and really enjoyed it. the hottest hot sauce in the pack is so darn hot it had me burning for about 30 minutes and washing my mouth out with water for 10. other than that one , all the others were really good. the wooden case doesn &apos;t hold the bottles well but the sauces were good. i would buy it again.
1	i first tried these powdered green teas from stash last summer. this spring i wanted more , but the store i got them from didn &apos;t think the vendor would be carrying any. i was delighted to find that i could get them from amazon. i ordered a whole bunch and look forward to having refreshing real food drinks all summer in an easy to make form.
0	i ordered this saffron after looking at seller feedback and assumed that since this is expensive it will be premium quality. but only after i put it in water for sometime , then the color of the flakes changed , and i realized that its a fake one. dont waste your time on this.
1	its hard to find in the us my husband frm jamaica and he loves it he says it makes him fill full all day i get it every mo.
0	i bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is , &apos; unsulphered &apos; . i called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. although it does have a higher percentage of iron , i &apos;m going back to plantation.
1	by faar the best dried mangoes i have purchased. fresh and full of flavor. the 2 pach 20oz is probably the best value. order a lot because it will be done before you know it. trust me it is heartbreaking when you reach into the bag and only find mango crumbs.
1	these beans are trully wonderful and wonderfully priced. split a few down the length toss in a bottle of vodka or rum or some bourbon for a few days and you have a wonderfull drink. great for baking , make truly amazing vanilia bean cookies.
1	unexcelled as to price and equal in quality to the best !
0	these cups were difficult to cap ( putting the lids on securely was a comedy show ) and they created a mess when used in the keurig ; the water went everywhere. add together pia and mess with an end outcome of weak cup o &apos; joe = i &apos;m not a very happy buyer.
1	i love , and use the empty containers for medicine / advil in my purse , desk , suitcase. also line with felt to keep earrings. perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints. tiny and powerful without burning my mouth.
1	bisquick has made a wonderful gluten free product. from pancakes to biscuits and everything in between are light and fluffy ! garlic and cheddar or cinnamon and sugar is a great addition.
1	i have tryed the almond crunch and is delicious and healthy snack better than chips try it you &apos;ll agree
0	the cookies tasted too much like baby food prunes to be any good. also they included directions to freeze them when they arrived to keep them from spoiling. i would never buy these again.
1	this is a fabulous gift ! i ordered 3 and kept one to try-and they are awesome ! the presentation is great , chocolates delicate , creamy , crunchy , and tasty , easy to eat , not heavy. for a mass produced line , this is a real winner. better than most out there in its price range. love the 3 different flavors. will buy again. great hostess gift.
0	every brand deserves to have one loser. this is van houtt &apos;s worst flavor in my opinion ...
1	this was a really good idea and the final product is outstanding. i use the decals on my car window and everybody asks where i bought the decals i made. two thumbs up !
0	these k-cups are either extremely old or they &apos;re not authentic green mountain k-cups. the coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. both my spouse and i have noticed this independently of each other. i tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn &apos;t figure out who it was.
1	i use this with my audio technica condensor. works great for home recordings hooked up to garageband on macbook pro for rough recordings. its super simple to use and has a dial for the gain. it &apos;s not bulky which is a nice.
0	these sticks definitely don &apos;t look like ones in the picture. they are much thinner and imho not worth the money. i should have returned it but instead gave my dog ( gsd ) 5 at a time to keep her busy. i &apos;d stick with the redbarn or equivalent from another website.
1	short and brief. the product has a wonderful coconut taste and the pineapple addition is light and mildly sweet. i will certainly purchase this again.
1	good kit , however using the f-pack ( pear juice ) made it way too sweet , i ordered two more and intent to blend the kits , the second two with out the added pear juice.
0	i really love kettle brand chips , but these are rather disappointing. there is very little sour cream or onion flavor.
1	my scotties were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. the smell is kinda strong , but not bad. it &apos;s tolerablel.
1	these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste. chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning. i like the 2-oz size bags , just the right amount of chips.
1	i have the regular my k cup accessory that comes with the keurig , but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time , then wash them both out. i like these because they are disposable. and i can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when i want them. very convenient.
1	amazing taste , incredible quality. this is the best beef jerky i have ever had. i think it &apos;s even better than the other non-halal ones. this beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though i &apos;m a regular costumer of theirs. thumbs up !
0	i love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches , salads , etc. , but this drink was so vinegary that i got a bit of a tummy ache. it tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink. i tried really hard to like it , but no go.
1	i hate bugs , but i adore these bug bites chocolate squares ! the chocolate is smooth and sweet , and small enough to be a daily indulgence. plus , each square comes with a tiny insect flashcard with a photo and factoids for your favorite entomologist. pull the trigger on this one. your sweet tooth will thank you.
0	i realize this is healthy food for a baby , but the smell alone is bad enough to make any adult sick to their stomach. after half a spoonful , my daughter started making these gagging noises and proceeded to projectile vomit three times. i would not recommend this. we ended up throwing out the remaining jars. this is the only gerber food we have ever had this type of problem with.
1	if your not into healthy and into flax seed do not buy these. they are healthy and they taste like it ! i love them ... they are very good. my husband loved them too. it &apos;s all a matter of taste. if you &apos;re looking for a dunkan hines brownie these are not it.
0	i love dried peaches and normally respect the sunmaid brand. as such , i thought these were a bargain ( $ 12 for a 6-pack ) . unfortunately , they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. they are edible , but i think i &apos;ll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them.
1	i really enjoy these low calorie chips. they have a good flavor with a good crunch and are crisp. i was wondering if when ordering a case of these chips one could order their favorites and not the whole 6 flavors ? say just 2 flavors if desired ? ? its a great product. don &apos;t stop manufacturing them.
0	i believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious but not in this little package. my 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out. i tasted it and it was so lacking flavor. i &apos;ll be making this combination for her on my own in our beaba babycook. the other fruit and veggie combinations are great , but this offering missed the mark completely.
0	i usually drink french roast , either peet &apos;s or the costco variety. this coffee had a distinctive burnt taste , much more pronounced than peet &apos;s. it is drikable , but certainly not in the same league. will not return , but will only use in latte &apos;s , where the taste is mitigated by the milk
1	eat at your own risk. once i would open a bag i could not stop. good and salty.
1	i &apos;ve tried most of the virginia chutney co. ( vcc ) product range and particularly like their spicy plum chutney. it is good with cold meats , salads , cheddar cheese , and curries
1	a little more money than your average cookie , but very much worth it. you will not find a cookie like this anywhere else !
0	i don &apos;t expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup , but it should at least taste like there &apos;s some cocoa in it. i can &apos;t believe how bad this stuff tastes. i tried it 3 times , and then threw the rest away.
1	the pomegranate molasses arrived on time and in good condition. i encountered this as an ingredient in a mollie katzan cookbook and it did not disappoint. we thinned it just a little with warm water and used it as a side sauce for roasted asparagus at a barbecue , and got many rave reviews from our guests , vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike. i recommend both the vendor and this item.
0	i was so excited to order and receive this coffee but i was disappointed once i brewed a cup. the vanilla flavor came out but i tasted no pumpkin spice. there was no aroma of pumpkin ... nothing. it has a unique flavor which is good but it just was not what i was looking for.
0	the ad says 30 regular greenies , but the package i received says 27 greenies.
1	i have been feeding this to my 13 yr old beagle for years. newman &apos;s own is of excellent quality and it &apos;s certified organic. also , a large portion of sales are donated to charity.
1	this chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when i expected it to. i gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it.
0	got this same 4.4 lb bag at petsmart for $ 6. not a good price amazon ! our dog loves it though.
1	my dog has many food allergies , but these made-in-the-usa treats are free of wheat , corn , egg , and dairy. my dog can &apos;t get enough of them.
0	the idea is basically a good one , however , my large papillon ( all 20 lbs of her ) could not figure this one out-no matter how hard she tried. food is a huge motivate her but unless i helped her , eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up. i will say that the tug-a-jug had me trained !
0	i read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy , decent tasting cup of noodles. needless to say i found this not to be true. first , the consistency is gross and second , the taste is awful. maybe i am just not accustomed to eating crap. think twice before ordering this product. i wish i did.
1	very good price and we love our keurig trying the summer flavors are great and will probably order more before the end of the summer.
1	if you are looking for a rich chocolate cookie look somewhere else. but if you are looking for a fairly good tasting 100 calorie breakfast or snack these are pretty good.
1	great candy ! sweet and intense , low calorie and delightful. made with actual coffee , not just flavoring. fantastic. reasonably priced too.
0	initially , this product was priced fairly ( $ 15.51 for 12 cans ) and a quality product. no dented cans noted. however , it should be noted that the price hiked 150 % in 1 month. regardless of the current economy , what was a fair price , quickly became ridiculous. i will not purchase this product again.
1	my family loves all three flavors. the dark chocolate is my favorite. the price was unbeatable. i will buy this product again.
0	i am so disappointed- this product is not eligible to return , but the items i received were outdated ! the use by date was even before i submitted the order , and the seller sent product they should have seen were beyond the best by date- at least 6 weeks before they processed the order.
0	this is my fourth order of these pork rinds and i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s up , but something &apos;s really amiss. the bags are leaking some kind of grease and don &apos;t fluff up during the microwave process. i used to love these , so hopefully this is just a bad batch. if not , then lowrey &apos;s needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack.
1	these smell so good i &apos;m tempted to try them myself ! i have to keep real chocolate locked up in my house because my two chocoholic dogs will raid cupboards and chew open drawers to get to it , but they are very happy with these instead. i &apos;m so glad i found this safe alternative for them.
1	this is a serious cup of joe. yummyness ! i have turned at least 3 friends onto this coffee. robust and aeromatic
0	there is no listed info. what am i buying here ? pic shows four packs. what size ? what flavors ? i can &apos;t buy something if i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m buying.
1	these are great treats ! my dog is older and has a few extra pounds so i decided to buy these for her. she loves them. also keeps her occupied for some time while she is eating it.
1	this coffee has a nice bold flavor , not too strong , but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful , full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable. if you like a distinctive , medium bold cup of coffee you will love this.
1	if you are looking for a great gluten free snack you won &apos;t be sorry you chose this product. my favorite flavor is the apple and nut.
1	i tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck. so i decided to try good ole amazon.com and selected this product. it is so good .. add a few herbs and it &apos;s a great side dish , or add more and make a &quot; pasta type &quot; salad.so very good. i am hooked. great flavor and so easy to prepare !
0	i was a bit disappointed in these. they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture. my son ( 6 ) does not like them.
0	i was sent english breakfast tea in a decaf earl grey box. the incorrect k-cups were in the wrong box and strewn haphazardly in the box. it seemed rather unprofessional , like someone had just thrown what they had in their kitchen in a box and sent to me. i am not happy to say the least. amazon customer service was wonderful and refunded me.
1	recommended to me by a friend i saw at the gym - had seen them a few times at the fatted calf in napa , but didnt really pay attention. i will never buy beans in the bag from the grocery store again. huge difference in taste and quality. sent my son who is an aspiring chef and gourmet foodie a box of beans in a bag as well ...
1	these things are seriously beyond delicious ! ! just the right touch of saltiness to go with the sweet. a perfect dessert or cheat snack for those long work days : )
1	great before , during , and after a workout. great natural electrolytes , very high in potassium , amazing drink ! this is my favorite flavor , tangerine is 2nd
1	it tastes good and is little sweet so my first thought was that it had a lot of sugar. i looked on the box and was surprised that it did not have that much. ( a plus for me )
1	this is one of the best gluten-free mix on the market ! ! ! it makes fluffy pancakes and light cornbread. also it is a great price ! i have had different mixes on the market in all price ranges and this is the best ! ! !
1	our dog loves these treats. we sprinkle a few into his regular dry dog food , and he gobbles everything up as fast as he can. we also use them as rewards for good behavior. wonderful , nutritious , really good to have on hand at all times.
1	if u have not tried this u r missing the best thing u could cook for your family.i give this 10 stars.
1	its great to be able to get sugar this way.its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body , and i am helping the fair trade farmers.it is a good thing all around.i am happy i can get it in amazon.
1	i &apos;m so dissapointed these are unavailable right now ! i love these crackers with cream cheese - it &apos;s my favorite snack ! i hope they become available again soon ! i can &apos;t find them anywhere !
1	i love this product and order it quite often for my big boys to take hunting. just wish the seller would take the time and money to change the label to say mild instead of spicy. it isnt spicy and they have at least put a sticker on the package but have not changed the discription on line so i thought i was actually purchasing spicy this time. still a wonderful product.
0	three of us tried it ; one of us was barely able to drink it , with ice. i guess this is , like evian , an &quot; acquired taste. &quot; unless you &apos;re able to try a single bottle before purchase , i recommend you pass.
1	these have a good snap when you bite into them and a nice honey beef taste ! choo choo r snacks always has excellent customer service , and they throw in a few samples as well !
0	i wouldn &apos;t even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit. how can i compare other items online or in a store ?
1	these shortbread cookies are delicious. i bought some while in london this summer. they are hard to find and expensive in usa.
1	one of the best for our 11 year old jack russell mix. i always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken , not a byproduct.
0	while i think this product is good , i &apos;m disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight , the 6 looks very much like an 8. same size box , less product , hmmmm.
0	this stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. my son didn &apos;t like it either and i ended up throwing it out.
0	second time i have reported this. one jar broken and order not what pictured. jam same but jar different. i know my ginger this not same.
1	i live on salt and as a result have hypertension. these products work surprisingly fast to lower your high blood pressure and to put it as nice as possible , keep you alive longer. and , that is a scientific fact , as salt is only a habit and has no real useful pupose except to cause many unhealthy habits and conditions. keep caring about us and don &apos;t stop producing foods that are very healthy.
1	save a little money buying in larger quantities , as opposed to the smaller bottles. i like the taste of agave , cross between honey / maple. good for pies , cereal , frozen yogurt , etc.
0	it seemed like it worked at first but after a week the ants were back with more growing. very frustrating. combat gel worked last year but could not find it this year.
1	nice serving size , good complement to breakfast. low in fat , high in protein , and taste great. i keep the unused portion in the freezer and microwave them , or heat them in a pan if you want a crispier outside. they are pre-cooked. love &apos; em !
0	the shipment was prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2. i love dark french roast coffee , but , this coffee tasted burnt and additionally , the flavor had overtones of trash indonesian. not a pleasant experience.
1	this tangerine soda reminds me a lot of the drink called orangina but with a pronounced tangerine flavor. it is basically an all natural carbonated juice. it is very refreshing and pleasant tasting. over all i like it a lot.
1	the product is very good. way too expensive and at almost 5.00 a box to get pancakes or biscuits i was disappointed
0	tastes too sweet , which jerk seasoning is not. walker &apos;s woods is the most authentic to taste. this was a waste.
0	i tried to &quot; cook &quot; 6 different bags of these. only a fraction of product &quot; popped up &quot; . the ones that managed to pop tasted overly salty and had an unusual flavor. unfortunately , they were not returnable , so the rest will be going to the trash. waste of $ $ $ .
1	i have tried a lot of s &amp; v chips and these are the best ! real sea salt and real vinegar ! mouth-watering flavor &amp; crispiness. not for the faint of heart - the flavor is very authentic ! : )
1	bought this box of chips as a father &apos;s day gift because dad loves them. they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips.
0	i really like this coffee but , i &apos;ll be dammed if i &apos;m going to pay $ 91.8 cents a cup just to support gm &apos;s stock price.i hope whatever they &apos;re smoking over in corporate is worth it ..
1	we have these suto delivered. they are a great healthy sub for potato chips and the snack bags are a perfect size. great crunch and we enjoy all the flavors.
1	i know -- the description is clear enough about apples &amp; cranberries but i found these sausages to be a little too sweet. my guests agreed. the same company makes sausages that i like better.
1	i was looking for mint green tea i could carry with me to mix up while out and about. if that &apos;s what you want , then this product is perfect. i add a little extra water , but that &apos;s just my taste. so , if you &apos;re looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further !
1	these potatoes are very good along with all their steaks and hamburgers. i would definately recommend omaha steaks to anyone looking for a gourmet dinner at a reasonable price !
0	the products lid stays attached to the needle on the keurig , allowing coffee grounds to fall everywhere. very messy. if this didn &apos;t happen , it would work well.
0	nong shim &apos;s noodle that you need to boil to eat , it &apos;s good. but these ones , the noodle &apos;s texture is totally different . it &apos;s the same as those cheap ramen noodle. the seasoning is not good either. i will never buy this kind anymore.
1	i have only had this once as banana pancakes so i &apos;m not sure how it tastes without fruit , but it was the best pancake i &apos;ve had in a long time. thank you for making a gluten free bisquick , i will try biscuits with it next !
1	i love oreos but hate the filling. these prevent me from having to scape the filling out and they &apos;re good for you - calorie wise.
0	loved the idea , but it only took my lab puppy less that 10 minutes to open this and destroy it ! ! the only thing left is the purple &quot; rope &quot; from the middle , which is now a great chew toy. too bad--the whole thing should be made out of indestructible material !
1	i use this to quickly make gluten / egg / dairy free pancakes. i use rice milk and engerg egg replacer to make pancakes. they taste pretty good and are a good snack to make for later and store in the fridge. they &apos;re especially good w / either apple butter or peanut butter on them besides the usual maple syrup !
0	i &apos;ve only bought one roll of these at the store. the first taste is ok , but there is a really weird aftertaste that i can only describe as tasting &quot; moldy &quot; ? bought the wintergreen version as well and they definitely do not have the odd aftertaste.
1	these biscuits are delicious , not too sweet , with just enough crunch. we love them. quick delivery. we would order them again. very satisfied.
1	these chips are flavorful without all the fat of fried. i love love the bbq flavor. i also like how the chips don &apos;t crumble in the bag.
0	the taste is not horrible but it is not very good. there is not a very good mango flavor. i would not buy again.
1	bought these for my daughter &apos;s grad party as well as the strawberry. she loves these things. they &apos;re a great product.
1	we are big izzie fans , but we were excited to try this sode. we were very pleasantly pleased. it is a very orange taste , delicious and it feels good to know there is absolutely no sugar. so , when our children want a soda we serve this and they are delighted. it &apos;s a win / win !
1	my daughter loves these snacks and so does everyone else. i try to feed my daughter organic stuff and i &apos;m so glad that earth &apos;s best makes a variety of snacks that she can have.
0	i love guatemalan coffee. it &apos;s pretty much all i drink. i bought this stuff and it is perhaps the worst guatemalan i have ever tried .... it &apos;s stale , way too acidic , and leaves an oily aftertaste. this coffee would make a great gift for someone you dislike.
1	we first received stonewall pancakes as a gift. we have ordered them 2x on amazon who has the best prices. highly recommend this product. will return here to buy more ...
0	after trying several of these k-cups , we threw the rest of the box away. it only ever created flavorless brown water. we then tried the grove square dark chocolate cocoa k-cups , and were much happier.
1	kettle lightly slated chips are my favorite on the market. i don &apos;t care for the &quot; fancy &quot; flavors and these are salted just right. thick , super crunchy and full of flavor , they are the best !
1	everyone here who &apos;s tried exclusive energy has been surprised by its unique ability to pleasantly refresh ! hope it will become more readily available.
0	the taste isn &apos;t good , at least isn &apos;t good for japanese and chinese. its taste is basically sort of american japanese taste. plus the price isn &apos;t competitive. i &apos;d suggest asians never buy it.
1	we use this in place of sugar for almost everything. it has a light flavor , sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor. the best part is the lack of sugar highs and crashes due to its lower glycemic index.
1	i love these crackers. they &apos;re perfect when you want the light crunchy snack without the calories of other crackers. they &apos;re good topped with lox or cinammon and sugar.
0	i absolutely love this stuff , but i pay $ 2.00 to $ 2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store. why is this price so high ?
1	they taste awesome ! esp the salt n pepper one ! i love them and they are really healthy ! the packaging is really good ..
1	this is an excellent product. it is healthy , delicious , has a great texture and feel in your mouth and goes perfectly with hummus or other spreads !
0	i love the taste but have found that many of the cups explode ! ! the glue on the side of the cup becomes undone and then the cup explodes. very hard to clean up. do not think i will buy this brand again !
1	always a fan of la tourangelle oils , this time the hazelnut oil was received as a gift via amazon. not only is the oil wonderful and delicate for salads , and some sauteeing , amazon now packages the cans to come dent free and protected. great buy !
1	the mouth says , &quot; how do i love thee , let me count the ways ... &quot; if you like apple products a must have item. the only draw back , shipping cost. these are very heavy.
1	received in a timely manner and in good condition. my mishka is a little spoiled ( i cook her meals when i can afford it , buy her wellness kibble when i can &apos;t ) but she ate this willingly. i bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping , unlike the much heavier wellness bag , and she was almost out of kibble. i &apos;m happy with the compromise.
1	purchased a small case of these tomatoes. i used them for pizza sauce and they tasted great. the labels looked identical to the picture posted on amazon.
0	you know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old ? that &apos;s how these were at the top. they were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. that part just didn &apos;t taste right , but the liquor inside was good. these candies weren &apos;t fresh.
1	i love coffee and at night really miss out if i don &apos;t have the decaff.
0	when i first took a bite , i seriously thought i was eating dog food. these are disgusting. i searched the bag for &quot; dog food &quot; and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons. i don &apos;t know how anyone can like these.
1	my entire family and my extended family ( cousins ) love the entire product flavor line. why have they taken this product out of the stores ? several large food store chains have taken the products off their shelves. why ?
0	this coffee is only mediocre in quality. i do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do i like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. the only reason i am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that i paid very little for it by using a credit i had at amazon payments. i do not recommend this coffee.
1	wonderful product. all the bread mixes i have tried on amazon are not disappointing ! ! ! will be back for more. they will make great christmas presents.
1	if you like a bold cup of good coffee ... and have a keurig single up brewer , this is the flavor to buy ! never dissappointing with carbou mahogany !
0	my min-pin shows absolutely no interest in this item. he is usually very receptive to anything that dispenses treats.
1	this creme brulee is as good as any homemade ! why bother with homemade when you can get just as delicious from a box ! easier to make too !
1	i &apos;ve always liked salt and vinegar chips but most of the time the stronger flavor was at the bottom of the bag. not with these , the vinegar is overflowing right from the first chip and doesnt stop until you &apos;ve finished the bag. these are very addictive. if you like salt and vinegar , these are the ultimate chips. nothing else compares.
1	my dog loved these and i think they probably helped with his gas and dare i say his breath too.
1	fresh scent and taste. easy to eat one tin in few hours. i use them as favors and everyone loved them.
1	my 3.5 yr old daughter with autism loves these ! she is on a special gluten-free , casein-free and soy-free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her.
0	the wheat free brownie mix is not to my liking. i won &apos;t be reordering. i &apos;d rather not eat chocolate than to eat these brownies.
1	easy to use ( do not abuse ) , &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000h27nu6 &quot; &gt; ghirardelli chocolate premium hot cocoa mix , double chocolate , 16-ounce tins ( pack of 4 ) &lt; / a &gt; great taste. it makes you to feel good.
1	this coffee is great because it &apos;s all organic ingredients ! no pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma.
1	if you &apos;re setting out a whole can at once or transferring some of it to a container for later use , flip the can over and use a can opener to remove the bottom of the can. you can then pop the top of the can , releasing the vacuum holding the food in place and the whole thing will slide out cleanly. much easier and tidier than scraping out the can with a spoon !
0	i purchased these because they do not contain dairy , soy or corn. well , in addition to being dairy free , soy free .... they are flavor free ! absolutely horrible dry tasting bars. first words out of my mouth were &quot; tastes like dirt &quot; so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going with. do not waste your money.
0	i received this item as a gift. as shown in the product images , this box contains a very small amount of candy for the price you pay. the candy is good , but paying almost $ 20 for $ 2-3 worth of candy is ridiculous !
1	this is a really great k-cup cocoa. i had been drinking the cafe express but they have really gone up lately so this is a good buy . nice creamy chocolate flavor so i switched to this. i found it at walmart but this price is better here for the 3 pack. give it a try : )
1	this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. pop 1 into each water bottle and you &apos;re set. flavor is fine and goes down easy.
0	i was surprised by the number of 5 star reviews of this product. its a tiny gritty seed that gets stuck in every corner of your mouth and the taste is like nothing. kind of like poppy seeds but with out the taste. i finally ask myself why am i eating this annoying seed and put it out back in the bird feeder unfortunately they don &apos;t seem to like it much either.
1	you can taste the wood in the respect it taste like the coffee was roasted over wood. it is very smooth , i detect no bitterness or over roasting. nice flavor. my newest favorite amoung the k-cup line. my old favorite was donut shop but not any more. i am not as pleased with the other caribou flavors but this one really surprised me.
0	the bookdinders ( old original ) snapper soup was just aweful ... threw all remaining cans in trash. no one in the family liked it. waste of money
0	not kosher ! ! ! ignore the symbol ! ! ! they are not kosher and not certified by any company ! ! ! i contacted the company to confirm.
1	better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. takes lots of water. these are not minute oats , so my oatmeal cookies come out right , not all crumbly and soggy. ( instant oats have their place , but not in cookies ) .
0	this sells for $ 29.99 at bed , bath and beyond. add your 20 % off coupon and you &apos;re good to go ... i also had cabinet issues and returned it to bb &amp; b.
0	i bought this item to get miso soup with less sodium. imagine my surprise when it has more sodium than the &quot; regular kind &quot; of miso soup. i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll get it again ...
0	in all fairness my friend absolutely loves this product. i purchased it based upon his suggestion. unfortunately , the smell ( oil i am assuming ) of it cooking made me feel ill. even though the product cooked perfectly , the smell lingered in my microwave for well over a day.
0	way too heavy on carbonation. what flavors were there were too weak to detect. sorry , but i won &apos;t be buying this one.
0	i love caramel and was excited when this arrived. but i am so disappointed. hardly any flavor at all , of coffee or caramel
0	i bought this product and when it arrived it was not organic. beware ! the package shown in the photo is not an organic product.
1	if you are a man this is the best you can do for your health , eat pumpkin seeds. bob &apos;s red mill has the best grown here in the good old usa. the others are from china , enough said.
0	i received an undersized , sickly plant that could not be nurtured back to health. what was i thinking ordering a plant over the internet ? never again !
1	love these pop-chips ! the variety bag was a great deal , especially with the $ 5 off. tasty , low fat- just what i needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. i highly recommend these !
0	only good use for these would be : in case of poisoning , use to induce vomiting !
1	great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. i like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.
0	they decided to ship both my order in one huge box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box , 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house. then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented
1	excellent customer service , quick ship , very well packed merchandise. my new supplier of all things hot ! .
0	i am disappointed in these-- they taste greasy and i can &apos;t return them ! they have 11 gm of fat and 9 gm of saturated fat !
1	these were on backorder for a long time but well worth the wait. i can finally use the coffee beans i &apos;ve had for awhile and have a great cup of coffee with no grounds. i totally love the product and will definately order more in the future. would like to see them in 100 count.
0	i recieved my bacon crisps. the price is ok , but i did not order hot &amp; don &apos;t know how to change my subscription.
0	this itty bitty tree was alive when it arrived , i &apos;ll say that for it. interesting little pot , but it has no moisture tray , the all important one mentioned as the number one thing you need for the trees health in the accompanying instructions &gt; ? 0.o ( regular wtf moment ) please include tray ! ! !
1	i love this tea. it is , hands down , my favorite. and the ingredients are very &quot; clean &quot; and it &apos;s low calorie--especially compared to other teas out there. this is the real deal. it &apos;s basically like making it at home. it &apos;s so yummy ! light , refreshing. i could drink it all day , by the gallon. : )
0	all of the items listed on the description were not included in the box. i was missing at least 4 food items.
1	there isn &apos;t much to say about this mustard other than &quot; ummm ummm good ! ! ! &quot; i tried this for the first time at a bbq on a salmon burger and it truly brought the flavor out of the meat ... now i use it on everything from chicken burgers to homemade caesers dressing ! you &apos;ll love it ! ! !
0	my dog loves chicken breast treats. that is , until i bought these. i &apos;m sure this is simply a matter of taste. i don &apos;t know if the additives smell different or what &apos;s turning him off but he &apos;ll pick it up and then just drop it. he refuses to eat them at all.
0	i like a darker roast i guess. its ok , prob would not buy again. i brew it on the middle selection on the keurig , not the full cup.
1	my 2 year old recently was diagnosed allergic to gluten. these pb &amp; j bars have saved us. he loves them and these are his favorite flavor.
0	the rooibos is fine but the early grey flavoring is far too sweet and heavy handed. tastes more like a perfumed tea than a balanced blend emulating the classic black tea version. i &apos;ve had very fine rooibos versions of early grey so i know it can be done.
0	i fully agree with the last few reviews. altoids were ruined when they started adding food coloring. wintergreen altoids are horrible now. these were the only mints i would buy , but i won &apos;t be buying them any more. fake sugar , fake flavor , fake color = no deal
0	honestly , with the amount of sugar in these , they are not much better than eating a 300 calorie regular cookie. i don &apos;t think these are that &quot; healthy. &quot; the cookies taste fine , but i won &apos;t repurchase.
1	mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious , easy , quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests.
1	this mustard is not for the mild-mannered , but for those who truly appreciate great german food ! this product is original as sauer kraut und rot kohl ! its taste is very original and authentic for those who will appreciate a bit of zip in their mustard. try it on brats , burgers ( etc. ) , and you simply won &apos;t be disappointed. alles gute ! jim
0	pop chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of &quot; munchos &quot; which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. period.
1	i love earth &apos;s best products. that &apos;s the only product i use for my baby ! my baby loves it and i never had any problem with it. it organic which makes it all that much better !
1	we first tried this because our toddler went through a picky-eater phase. she loved these ! they are crunchy and small enough for her to pick up. i love them because they are organic and a veggie that she actually asks for. i mainly give them to her right out the package but i &apos;ve also mixed them into scrambled eggs , which she really likes too.
0	i like the idea of getting grains out of cat food , but using peas instead doesn &apos;t seem to be the answer. carnivores ( at least my cat ) doesn &apos;t tolerate peas. vomiting began in about 2-3 weeks and is now instantaneous. eat some cat food--go right to throwing up. both chicken and salmon. so for me it was a waste of money and very disappointing.
0	this coffee is equivalent to pilon gourmet coffee. it is not any better than the regular grade of bustelo. bustelo can be purchased for $ 2.50 to $ 3.00 a brick. their supremem coffee is not worth one penny more.
1	these are the best canned tomatoes i have tasted. they have a fresh flavor , similar to home-canned. this is my second time buying a set. they are a little more acidic / bright , and have a rounder flavor than other tomatoes. comes with a basil leaf in each can. note , the 28 oz tins are a better value than the 14 oz ones.
0	this jerky was a terrible gift and even the dog can &apos;t chew through it. will not be reordering this item.
1	these are the best tasting chips ever ! i can &apos;t get them anywhere here in denver area so went to the internet to find them. wouldn &apos;t you know amazon came thru ! only concern is that they arrive a little crumbled---i guess understandable considering they &apos;re being shipped. however , not so in store , when i could still get them here. really grateful that i can get them at all.
0	i was really disappointed in these olives. the are very mushy and i prefer a more firm texture. cat cora &apos;s olives are much , much better.
1	perfect ! these are great vintage looking lollipops for our vintage wedding. good quality. pic on amazon selling page is what you get.
1	i love these. i love any floral flavored product. the best part is when people ask for a mint or candy or whatever , offer these but don &apos;t tell the flavor. the reactions are youtube worthy.
0	looks nothing like the picture , it &apos;s simply a baby plant with a pencil straight twig of a trunk. tiny , it &apos;s a joke right ? this company should be banned from amazon for behavior like this.
0	the coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt. i cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt. will not order this again.
0	my dogs who will generally &quot; play &quot; or destroy any toy had no interest. i tried placing everything short of hotdogs into the jug with no avail.
1	this offer is a great price and a great taste , thanks amazon for selling this product. staral
1	at an early age my beagle ( yes , a beagle ) was picky about eating. crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat. now it has become part of the routine.
0	as hard as i tried i just couldn &apos;t smell that french vanilla aroma.next time i &apos;ll stick to lipton. definitely not a good buy.
1	i made this for my 12 year old grandson. &quot; grandma this is the best hot chocolate i have ever had in my whole life ! &quot; you can guess what he got for christmas. it really has a wonderful flavor. top it off with whipped cream.
1	i am very impressed with the flavors. all of them ! there were a few flavors i wasn &apos;t sure i was going to like .... but they are really good also ! the flavors are very intense. you are not getting a bland chip. i &apos;m on the monthly plan but i &apos;ve already had to order them ahead of schedule twice !
0	we bought this for our paramount 6 oz popper. we were disappointed by the taste. we &apos;ve been using louana coconut oil ( ~ &#91; .. &#93; from walmart for 31.5 fl.oz. ) , act ii popcorn salt and o.r. kernels. after the first mouthfuls of great northern popcorn , people were pushing their bowls aside---it tasted like salted cardboard. never again---so disappointed.
0	i was disappointed when i received this shipment , as the seaweed contains msg , and it &apos;s not listed as an ingredient. amazon was very gracious and refunded me the amount of purchase.
0	well , at least they live up to their name. these nuts are definitely hot , too bad that &apos;s all the positive i have to say about them. other than that , they taste like cardboard , and not very good cardboard either.
0	i love the cereal , but my local safeway ( san jose california ) has priced this product at $ 4.79 each , one sale today at 4.49. some on-line sellers are even higher than amazon ! i &apos;m underwhelmed by the lack of inexpensive product online.
1	these prunes saved so many of my baby &apos;s uncomfortable constipation days when he started on solids. the puree seems to be easier to consume than prune juice and we used to give it to our baby with yogurt. it soon became his favorite food and eased his symptoms. i highly recommend this product to parents who are having a hard time with their babies &apos; constipation.
1	this is so soothing , smooth , &amp; rich ! love this as my afternoon treat ! gf does have a history of discontinuing great favors , i hope this one sticks around. ( kahlua , white chocolate to name a couple ! )
0	do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of pb. i love pb found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. i iove amazon but ask these 5 * ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.
1	the breakfast blend has always been one of my personal favorites from gevalia. gives whole new reason to getting up early on saturday. plus , the amazon price could not be beat !
1	my dog is allergic to most dog food. i have used newman &apos;s own dog food for several years now and i am quite happy with it. i live in a small town that is 60 miles away from the nearest big city and i am unable to obtain the dog food locally. it is a real convenience for me to buy this from amazon and the price is equitable.
0	i bought this for my 20lb puppy on the advice of my trainer. what a disaster ! not only was i bruised from her swinging it around trying to get the treats out , but so were my walls and furniture. within a week the plastic jug broke and that was the end of it.
0	these were awful ! i have had these many time s before but this box was below par and gives both me and my husband strong heartburn. i would have sent them back but by now , half used , i am just ordering other different ones and putting these in the bun. i wonder if anyone else has had this problem ?
1	i have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year , and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. when i look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food , it is downright nauseating ! i bought some of this newman &apos;s own and my dog loves it. she usually gobbles it up the minute i put it into the bowl.
1	i started using &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b008ema3as &quot; &gt; lourdes gourmet chimichurri sauce &lt; / a &gt; on my grilled steaks and fell in love with it. now i &apos;m putting it on my chicken , vegetables &amp; pasta. i &apos;m turning into a real chimichurri addict.
0	i don &apos;t think it &apos;s eb , i think it &apos;s amazon. i buy eb from babies r us , target and whole foods , and haven &apos;t had any problems. it &apos;s only the shipments from amazon that come moldy.
0	this quinoa has to be rinsed ! i would not have ordered it if i had known that. there are many other brands for the same price that don &quot; t require this annoying and messy step.
1	i am hooked. this is a great way to get more fluids into my day without making it seem like a chore. this powder tastes great without any additional sweeteners. it is just what i have been looking for. also try the blueberry version. delicious !
1	excellent product ! a tip from the keurig people : shake the k-cup before using it. this prevents the cocoa from clumping and results in more flavor.
1	i ordered 3 6lb bags with free shipping because of the reviews. i really like it but the real test was my wife &apos;s opinion and we also ordered 4 and 1 / 2 lbs of popcorn from the boulder popcorn co and the kernels were a little smaller and tasted better. we use coconut oil and it has very good flavor even without butter. i really like the cambria &apos;s cream kernels the best
0	i ordered the disposa kups with the thought of making my own kups. they don &apos;t fit together without a big production. the lids won &apos;t fit and water comes out the top of the brewer lid as well as the kcup. just a big mess. not what i wanted at all. want to return them and get a refund. donna phillips
0	healthy choice lunch express meals are terrible. not healthy. packaging and marketing and yet more plastic to choke the planet. the calorie count is reduced because the box is full of air. make your own lunch.
0	i was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good. i brewed it on small setting and big , very weak , not of quality. i have one of the raspberry and one lemon i have to figure out how to get rid of.
1	this licorice is great. it taste like the old fashion rope licorice. i will continue to buy it.
0	really weak by my standards , i have to use the smallest volume on the keurig to get decent flavor. get extra bold cups instead if you don &apos;t like watery coffee.
0	i tried to use these dried morels as a substitute for fresh morels in a chicken dish and they were lacking in flavor. morels should perfume a dish and these mushrooms did nothing when rehydrated.
0	these aren &apos;t clearly labeled &quot; gluten free &quot; . they say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. they are a weird flavor , sort of costly and not worth it. eew.
0	just bought a case of 12 boxes 9-15-10 they exp.12-2-10 no wonder there on sale ryvita thats not right.will be stale very soon.won &apos;t but again.
0	there is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it &apos;s like having sugar flavored chocolate , i am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag , other then that i would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet.
1	kettle chis are the best ever ! these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but i &apos;m sure this is just a personal preference. crunchy , real potato chips !
0	the units go together easily , but no matter how much or little coffee i put in the filter , it caused overflow. it &apos;s as if the filters are too thick. i also had a few cups that didn &apos;t pierce correctly. definitely not worth the money for these !
1	my daughter loved the little tin that came with her adagio tea set so much that i got her a cannister of this for christmas. i think it will end up being a regular gift as we all love it so much. it really is delicious , and with green tea being so good for you , we drink it all the time. all the products i &apos;ve tried from adagio have been wonderful.
1	this all natural licorice is very good -- i highly recommend it. i bought this as i a read natural licorice is good for an upset stomach.
1	royal canin was recommended for my dog , but since this line of dog food is specific to breed , it was difficult to find in stores. petsmart and petco carried the cocker spaniel formula but only in smaller bags which is much more expensive on a per ounce ratio. finding a larger bag has been a great deal. my cocker loves the food too !
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000eh2ama &quot; &gt; mrs. may &apos;s dry-roasted snack , pumpkin crunch , 2-ounce pouches ( pack of 24 ) &lt; / a &gt; pumpkin crunch is great. stick with 2oz. size ( 2 servings ) much too easy to consume entire 5.5oz. bag without realizing it. : -d lol
0	this batch was horrible. since most regular coffee were out of stock , i tried this one. it tastes and smells awful. do not buy this flavor.
1	i ordered these for my upcoming wedding candy buffet. i am doing all navy and white and these go perfectly. they are individually wrapped and a true navy color. the packaging was great. each lollipop is wrapped in bubble wrap. love them !
0	i purchased this as a gift for someone who said the meat was bad. i was disappointed that i sent it as a gift. since it &apos;s not returnable , i guess it &apos;s just a live and learn type of thing. after reading a couple other reviews ( hindsight and all that ) , i would not recommend this item at all.
1	i really like this product. it tasted great and only took a few minutes to make in the microwave.
0	this is a very nice product but netrition has for the exact same item for one half of the price ,
1	my one year old loves this product. she eats one every day and never gives me a problem. and i trust the ingredients which reassures me that she &apos;s eating something thats good for her.
1	this is a very mild hot cocoa. perfect for those winter evenings or even good in the morning instead of coffee. we love it anytime. next time i will try the dark chocolate.
1	this product is the way to go for making your own favorite blend of coffee and loose leaf tea. i use them for tea and found that i can reuse them for two or three cups.
1	bought it thinking this would plug into the wii and i would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. well , long story short , doesnt work. but it is still usable with a pc / laptop to record audio. but we can do that with a builtin mic also. would u like to pay 1 $ towards the presidential election ?
1	love these popchips. they are all great. do not care for the salt &amp; pepper flavors. i wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn &apos;t include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase i make ( and i &apos;ve made alot ! ) . the bbq , original , salt &amp; vinegar and sour cream &amp; onion chips are superb !
1	this canned food has real chunks of chicken in it. dogs love it. looks and smells better than human-quality canned beef stew ( like dinty moore ) .
1	i have purchased san francisco bay coffee before. i have always found that the quality of their coffee is excellent. the beans are always well chosen and slow roasted. a very high quality coffee at a reasonable price.
1	i love the chamomile tea. its sweet and mild. its excellent for a bed time tea.
1	i miss the king b ripple style and the regular jerky too. thanks jack links for at least offering this.
1	i like to eat frozen vanilla yogurt but the catch is that i have to make it myself or it doesnt get done. these vanilla beans are amazing if you are really into vanilla.yougurt or icecream
0	i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars , ever in my life. they taste okay , but i just can &apos;t choke them down , even with coffee.
0	received delivery 3 days prior to estimated time. brewed tea - very light taste - noticed that it got darker after removing tea bag after two minutes. flavor and aroma are not very strong ...
1	these brownies are good , but the flax seed texture can be a real turn-off. to minimize it , i added a little whole wheat flour , splenda and cocoa - big improvement and my guests never complained ( like they did the first time i made the brownies ! ) .
0	i bought the exact same thing at walmart.com last week for $ 8.95. walmart sells all the flavors in the 51 oz. canister for this price. why on earth amazon is selling this for over $ 20.00 escapes me. do yourself a favor and buy the exact same thing from walmart.com or anybody else for a decent price. don &apos;t get ripped off ...
0	i am a a vegetarian , and this is my least favorite &quot; jerky &quot; . the texture is sort of slimey and after a couple bites , i had had enough.
0	this is my first time and i can &apos;t eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. is there something wrong with my batch ? i can &apos;t eat them or they would break my teeth am i doing something wrong i only cook them 1 min.
1	the smell alone will make you salivate , it is that good. it comes with rock sugar mixed in , so i don &apos;t ever use any added sweeteners.
0	i didn &apos;t notice any difference as far as energy or focus from using this product. i gave it two stars because like so many products , there is always the capacity of it functioning as a placebo. it also tastes like orange juice more than anything. still , this is far too expensive of a product for me to consider buying it again.
0	if you like cough syrup you will like this garbage , it tastes just like cough syrup and not at all like root beer.
0	all but a handful of the shipment were defective. when brewing the water flowed through very slowly and large quantities of grounds were released into my cup - gross. the only way to use them is to empty the contents into a reusable k-cup.
1	this is the only food my cat will eat. if i buy another variety or brand , it sits in her bowl until it gets stale &amp; i throw it out.
0	my personal preference is to stay clear of this. i did not like the smell or taste. i was attempting to make pizza crust for the first time. on my second attempt it came out better , but i did not like the taste of it. if i at least liked the taste , i would buy again and make my crust very thin.
1	these are wonderful ! exactly like the originals , only in miniature form. delicious and crispy and the wonderful amaretto flavor ! rapid shipping from the seller as well !
1	well being the big red fan that i am , i bought some of this. first of all let me tell you the price is amazing , i mean where else can you get this type of deal in saudi arabia. everyone in village loved it , of course now they are wondering when the next shipment will get it.
1	these disposable cups are great ! the simple , clean method of a portion pack but with your own grounds. now i need to see if they pack them in larger quantities. the seller was also great. i got what i wanted and ahead of time also. no issues to report here. anyone with the k-cup system needs to get this product from this seller.
1	this has been my favorite soup since childhood. i was pleased to find it available on amazon.com at a very reasonable price. now i plan to keep a good supply on hand at all times !
1	if you are trying to get off sugar , this is the product for you. i has a great sweet taste without spiking your insulin , and no bitter aftertaste. great for diabetics and anyone trying to eat healthy. i love this product.
1	i ordered the hot cocoa for my grandson for christmas. he loves the flavor and is able to make it on his own. delivery was good , i had it in several days but still in plenty of time for christmas. would recommend to anyone.
0	this product was horrible. i can &apos;t imagine that anyone would like it. i will never even consider this company again ,
1	this stuff is good. my mom gave me a bottle to go with some eggrolls and we were hooked upon first dip. the perfect blend between sweet and spicy , this stuff is so yummy that even people who claim to dislike &quot; spicy &quot; or &quot; asian &quot; or any other kind of exotic fare find it delicious !
0	i was soooo disappointed by this product. they would not take ! i guess i should have suspected from the low price. i had gotten fresh pablanos shortly before and they were wonderful , but these are not. i know these are terribly hard to find , thats why i took a chance , but do not waste your time on this product. ( scoring &amp; soaking will not help )
1	baking for my husband ( with type 2 diabetes ) just go easier. i can adapt regular receipes. i use only half the amount of sugar called for a bam ! they turn out great. the 4 pack is a great buy too !
0	all this is , is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a kcup delivery device. what a waste of money. also , grove square products are notoriously inferior.
0	for anyone who is a seasoned sencha tea drinker , this is tea is a total dud. it barely tastes anything like fresh , high quality sencha nor even older dried sencha leaves. i had to throw this in the trash because it &apos;s simply dreadful.
0	this stuff sounded perfect ... way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it ... kind of salty. basically , i would stay away from it. i am tempted to toss it out , but paid too much to feel right about it ...
0	this oatmeal was very bland tasting. i could taste a little vanilla flavor , but not the fruit. still i suppose i can buy some minced peach fruit cups , and mix one in. it was easy to prepare and pretty filling. i just expected a lot more flavor.
0	super bubble is my very favorite gum , and very hard to find here. the box i received was a real hit or miss. more than half the gum was brick hard - totally unchewable. i &apos;ve never run across this issue with this product and am very disappointed. i will take a chance and buy it again sometime in the future , but this particular purchase left a bad taste in my mouth.
1	i got this on a special and we are coffee lovers and like to try different kinds although yuban is our everyday coffee. well this was a surprise ! nice and flavorful , not bitter , smooth and maybe not as strong as yuban in the same amounts the was all there. if they start selling this in lagers amounts for a better everyday price i would buy more but as is its very pricey.
0	sorry , but i dont eat mexican or chinese made candies. i now buy pearsons or palmers peppermint patties. check the labels folks foreign factories dont have food safety regulations.
0	i guess everyone &apos;s taste buds are different. this product didn &apos;t work for me. every food item tasted as it should : - (
0	what can i say , it tastes like fish. like really fishy fish. texture is ok , salty , but not overly salty , but it is what it is , fish eggs.
0	the bonzai i ordered came well before the estimated date ... however ... the tree i got as a gift was tiny. nothing like it looks like in the product picture.
1	i have a 7 year old scottish terrier who has some food allergies. no wheat for my girl. : ) this treat is great for settleing an upset stomach and my dog looks forward to her charcoal bone treats.
1	decent every-day loose-leaf tea. the china mist brand is good , the only downside is some of the tea is pulverized too fine , so there is sediment in the tea. i recommend letting the tea settle before serving. china mist is not extremely high-quality , just a nice every-day tea that tastes fine. the sample pack gives you a chance to try some variety , and it lasts a while.
0	as other reviewers noted , more than dozen of items were broken , so the box was sticky and some of them still had creamer on them. also the expiration date is june 2010 which less than 6 months away , i wont be able to use them before the sell by date.
1	i love salsa and have tried many on the market. i served dippin fiesta at a recent sunday football get together and got rave reviews. maybe the best salsa i have ever tasted and served. if you want to taste the best , try this one.
1	just got this order and it is ok. a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me , if it is there.
1	one of the best lemon juice that i have tried. i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. when the season for fresh lemos is out , this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments. i will continue buying it.
1	everything i bought was great , infact i ordered twice and the third ordered was for my mother and father.
1	purchased this product at a local store in ny and my kids and i love it. its a quick easy meal. you can put in a toaster oven on toast for 6 min. and its ready to eat. strongly recommend
1	i drink three cups of this each day , made with one oolong tea bag and one green tea bag , in a large mug. i believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs. in the last five months. i drink it without sweeteners , and also cold. the price for this is very reasonable , and the taste is mild.
1	if you have a coffee grinder , this is the best coffee , i would highly recommend it ! the taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in holland , relaxing and watching the passersby ...
1	for 100 calories a bag , these are the closest thing you will get to regular potato chips , they have great crunch and flavor.
0	this is a pretty bad product. whatever the manufacturer intended , taste was not a priority.
0	wonderful color i don &apos;t know what to say extremely fast delivery. i was surprised how many were really in container. i personally did not like the flavor and couldn &apos;t find any of my kids who did. to their credit they did taste like &quot; juicy pear &quot; but for me they left a bad after taste in my mouth.
0	a wasten of money and time. we tried air popping--no more than 5 % popped. we tried skillet popping--same. have yet to find it already popped in bags--maybe that will redeem it , but not return my wasted time and money. birds and squirrels seemed to like it.
1	this product came as advertized .. it was a great buy and i love the taste of the tea great deal and happy i purchase from them.
0	my sister in law was up for a visit this weekend , so i thought it &apos;s be a perfect time to test out this coffee. neither of us were impressed. it didn &apos;t have a great flavor and she thought the texture was a bit oily. as far as low-acid goes , it did seem like it would be good in that department , but the taste made it so it wasn &apos;t worth drinking.
0	these quickly became dog treats ! just nasty ! i don &apos;t even know how they can sell these for human comsumption ! stay away !
0	i am a bacon fiend and was very excited to try baconnaise ! however , after a small taste , both my husband and i found it disgusting. it tastes very chemically and not so much like bacon - more like smoke flavoring. we threw it all away.
0	i have older mats that have a ribbed surface and work great. these have small stiff points and actually hurt to lean on or kneel on. i can imagine that they hurt my cats paws ad that is why they tend to jump over them when exiting the littler box.
0	i did not like this coffee. it is on the light side. it has too much acid or something , i felt almost ill after drinking it. i shared it with a co-worker and he felt the same way. i am a big coffee drinker and usually can drink very strong coffee and never have stomach upsets but do with this blend.
1	i don &apos;t write reviews at all but i &apos;m just going to say that this is a very decent product to buy if you &apos;re not looking to spend hundreds of dollars on a mixer , phantom power supply , and pre-amp for xlr mic recording. because guess what this little thing has it all in one all for a low price ! cop you one !
1	this is the perfect size for a snack bag for school. minus one star because the glue for the straws also glues the wrapper to all of the boxes. that &apos;s annoying.
0	i was extremely disappointed because out of a dozen cans half were dented. obviously , the person packing the box should have noticed the cans were damaged. we kept the shipment because we wanted the pumpkin and didn &apos;t want to go through the hassle of returning the cans.
1	not only is the sweetener great in coffee or ice tea it makes a slammin skinny margarita. also try their agava simple syrup - love it
1	this product is great if you want a dirty martini , i highly recommend this product and it saves you from buying olives and wasting just to get the brine.
1	this was delicious coffee for a great price which i could not find at any store in my area or areas nearby
0	at first , i was impressed by these round little cracker / chip things. the novelty wears off fast. i have decided they are quite gross.
1	i have subscribed these chips. they are so tasty. not dry or oily. cannot put it down once open a bag and have to have two bags in a row.
1	cant make corn tortillas or tamales without masa harina. these folks ship their product in sturdy boxes. great for making a long journey overseas.
1	the popcorn itself is yummy , just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper. the kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped. it &apos;s great in the microwave or a pan , but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper.
1	my wife always made her own gravy from scratch and is good at it. however , this gravy is fantastic , idiot proof ( even i can make it ) and reminds me of my grandma &apos;s cooking. my wife loves it and this will definitely be a new staple for our cupboard.
0	the new recipe has more dextrose than salt -- who on earth would want a * sweet * fishy caviar ? it makes no sense to anyone who loves the taste of light , salty caviar. very disappointing , and i hope romanoff gets rid of the person who had the brainwave to change caviar into candy-ar. arrrrh !
0	these pig ears are very greasy. there were also only a few large ears and the rest could hardly be called a pig ear. i would not recommend.
1	i really enjoy this coffee - i have used a variety of the k-cups and this is one of the best.
1	the beans smell great and you get a lot of them. if you get a 12 pack of jars and you put 2 beans in each jar , you will still have more than half of them left over. im trying to figure out what else i can do with them before they go bad.
1	these really are amazing chips. don &apos;t be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese ... it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters ( like me ) will enjoy these.
1	if you can get over the high price , why not enjoy some of the best coffee in the world , right here in the good ol &apos; usa ? warning : once you get spoiled by this coffee , you might not ever settle for less ! bottom line : great product , would recommend to a friend.
1	this stuff is the real deal ! not too soft , not too hard , not too salty , no fat , and a great smokey flavor with just a touch of spice that makes your tongue tingle. for a commercially produced product , this is really a satisfying strip of jerky. i was pleasantly surprised and will definately purchase again ...
1	i got my husband a brew kit from coopers for his birthday. the lager is the only beer he &apos;s tried to brew , but he says it &apos;s very easy and it tastes good. it tastes best if you only let it ferment in the bottles for a week. we &apos;re definitely going to try other flavors.
0	for a bit , amazon improved the packaging on these delightful biscuits. now they are back to their slacker ways and every single packet is broken and crumbly. shame on you amazon !
1	this is my favorite k-cup coffee ( i &apos;ve tried about twenty different types ) and , so far , everyone i &apos;ve served it to really likes it a lot. even the pickiest coffee connoisseur i know thought this k-cup made an excellent cup of coffee. two non-coffee drinking friends wish they liked coffee because they love the sound of caribou mahogany.
1	the actual product deserves 5 stars , the reason i gave it 4 stars is because its like three dollars at asianfoodgrocer.com. that &apos;s where i order it from , not amazon. much lower prices.
1	i had not been able to find kraft shake &apos; n bake at the two ( 2 ) grocery stores where i shop.i was so glad to find this product available through amazon.com. it was easy to order and was delivered very quickly. great service. thanks , laura w. phoenix az
0	i ordered 18 bags of york pieces for wedding favors , half of the bags were melted and amazon has a no return policy on food items. i would not order food products from a online vendor again.
1	pros : + packaging , shipping , price + sold about a year before its expiration date ( enough for me to eat / share 9 boxes ) + not too &quot; fresh &quot; like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form. it &apos;s a real mint ! cons : none !
0	this coffee is a little weak and not distnctive. you will be stopping at starbucks on your way to work. there are a few better ones out there. coffee people coffees seem to be the only ones that brew a coffee that does not taste watered down. as with all keurig coffees , it is not hot enough when it comes out of the machine.
0	i could get a better deal spending $ 25 in the check out isle at walmart. come on , i &apos;m glad i didn &apos;t send this as a gift to someone that was less forgiving.
1	i purchased this sauce as it is the exact same sauce used at the hot sauce bar of tijuana flats ( http : / / www.tijuanaflats.com / ) . it goes amazing with steak tostadas but in my home cooking , it works wells as a marinade and as a condiment.
0	i can get this at my local grocery store for $ 2.69 per can ( $ 32.28 for 12 ) .
1	we really have to limit additives and sugar for our son with autism. switch orange tangerine really fills the bill. he feels like he &apos;s getting &quot; real &quot; fizzy soda , and mommy is happy it &apos;s not loaded with chemicals and additives and actually has real juice in it. a total win-win.
1	no gas for baby , no extra bubbles when you shake it in warm or cold water , mixes perfectly without much time ... this is easy. my kid was happy swapping from breast milk to this with no hesitation when my milk dried up at 6mths.
1	everyone at my house , even my mother-in-law , enjoyed this drink. it tastes very much like a quality soda , but is made with 100 % real juice. small cans mean you don &apos;t consume a lot of calories at once , because although this is healthier than regular soda , you shouldn &apos;t drink too much -- it &apos;s still a lot of sugar.
1	i have purchased these though a local source for four dollars for a pack of eight. if you are not sensitive to msg then these are a delicious alternative to other salty snacks. the seasoning is tasty and the thin sheets of seaweed are lite and crispy ! i eat them two or three packs at a time ... 25 calories per. love them !
0	my guess is the other flavors of switch taste better. i thought this had an overkill berry flavor and aftertaste. it probably would have been okay if it were cherry flavored. that being said , i &apos;m not sure i would let my dislike of the flavor dissuade you from trying it. could just be a personal preference.
0	i purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business. when they arrived , it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper &quot; made in china. &quot; no way i &apos;m giving these to children if they were manufactured in china , following the whole poisoned pet food debacle. the fact that these are made in china needs to be highlighted much more clearly.
0	i am sure that this coffee tastes good , but i am not sure i will ever get to find out. each cup i insert into my keurig busts open when it is brewing. i don &apos;t think the seal can withstand the heat , and so it opens up and oozes grounds into my coffee ! yuck ! !
0	i should have listened to the negative reviews , but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. there was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto i made. i agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. not worth even this price for truffles.
1	the greatest , best chocolate taste in any keurig k-cups out there. will definitely order more. everyone in the office tries to steal them. i &apos;m a chocolate nut , and these pass the test.
0	cheap : a plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside. never worked right ; no user interface , no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power.
0	great audio , until a few months in it just decides to stop working. common problem : google it and you &apos;ll see. cheapest construction of any product every designed in the entire world. feels like a fast food toy. i do not recommend this product. piece o &apos; garbage.
0	these are no good. i got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly ... my kid won &apos;t eat them at all and i don &apos;t blame him. they have no flavor , and nothing seems to help. i wouldn &apos;t buy them again.
1	i &apos;ve heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their keurig k-cup brewers. the search is over ! this grove square hot cocoa received four big smiles from my sons. they just went on and on about how delicious it was ! i love having this new coffee pot where it &apos;s fast and convenient for all of us ! super happy with this purchase.
0	i ordered ka-me rice crunch crackers , plain. i received ka-me gluten-free rice crackers , original , all natural. unfortunately , they have soy products in this cracker and therefore i can &apos;t eat it. this looks different from the picture that came with the crackers i ordered. apparently i can &apos;t return the box of crackers.
1	these cups and filters work excellent. a cheaper alternative to use your own coffee. will definitely purchase more.
1	this is a high quality oolong tea and i can &apos;t go back to bigelow , that &apos;s for sure ! the taste is great , it is said to have slimming benefits , and the tea bags are a higher quality that don &apos;t come apart easily.
0	i agree with other one star reviewers ... this tea smells like grass .. if you get lucky , you can get the right balance and make a decent but always weak cup of tea ( ok-- delicate if you prefer instead of weak ) .. if you use a little too much then it is grassy and / or bitter. i guess you have to really like sencha green to use this tea.
0	was looking to buy some dried strawberries when i came across this offering. in the description it says air dried strawberries without sulphur dioxide. in the picture shown the ingredients list sulphur dioxide ! not saying it &apos;s good or bad but why can &apos;t they describe what they are selling accurately ? ? ?
0	perhaps arame seaweed is always bland and mealy , but i wasn &apos;t impressed when i made my first dish with this. the recipe specifically called for arame and hijike seaweed.
1	got this in a k cup sampler , the best k cup so far. if you like good strong coffee with a lot of flavor , slight hint of cocoa , this is it. no bitter after taste. this one goes on top of my reorder list , perfect for the k cup system. the one reviewer on this post that gave it one star has no taste buds.
0	quote &quot; assam tea is known for its body , briskness , malty flavor , and strong , bright color. &quot; this offering is pretty abysmal , it is lacking in every department , maybe it was mislabeled. i am not sure what i am going to do with it ! !
0	if this is white tea i &apos;ll brew my hat and drink it. i was surprised to find green tea in the bag labeled organic white peony ( 100 % organic white tea ) . whether they made a mistake or this is bait and switch , i &apos;ve consumed enough white and green tea to know the difference. i won &apos;t be buying from boston tea again , can &apos;t trust them.
1	the tea tastes great and helped me curb cravings during dieting. the tea was inexpensive and came packaged in a pretty box. the bags are flimsy , but i just throw the bag in a tea ball with no worries. i will continue to keep this on hand as part of my tea collection.
0	the salt free version has a very acidic taste that melts when in contact with your mouth. just my two cents ...
0	i thought i would change up my dogs food from newmans organic to this product but it was terrible my dog refused and when i put cooked chicken in it and the dog at it the dog had massive diarreha. i threw it away.
0	izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good. this one , unfortunately , is not. all i can taste in it is apple juice.
1	this drink is a nice blend of juices ( mostly orange ) and carbonated water. there are no other ingredients. it has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice , so it is not a low-calorie drink. i thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again.
0	the delivery was extremely quick , the packaging was fine , and if you suck off all the honey , the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. mind you , i could eat 3095826 honey roasted peanuts.
1	i got this product a while back. it was very delicious. i love trying to cook korean food. i would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking korean food. the hot pepper paste came in perfect condition.
1	we have been trying several chilis by small companies via amazon and this one so far is our favorite. i added some non-soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture.
0	this used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. very disappointed. and it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to happy baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.
1	i got it for my girlfriend for her birthday. the fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy ! i love dark chocolate , so i loved the dark chocolate almonds. next time i &apos;ll give the organic version of this product ... to someone close so they share with me : )
1	i received this as a gift a few weeks ago. it is by far the best home made pancakes i have every had. the taste and consistancy is excellent. blueberries mix very well with this product and the container is desinged to keep the product fresh and not let moths in. you pay a little more but it is worth it in my opinion
1	with this spice mix , you can recreate the taste of your favorite restaurant stews. it is potent , so do not use too much. it smells heavenly. perfect for both meat and bean stews.
1	couldn &apos;t find these anywhere but on line - it was worth the wait because they are trully great tasting cookies.
0	unlike the other coconut water products i &apos;ve purchased , this one contains sugar and the container is smaller. these two facts must be stated in the description but i had not noticed till i got the order. the drink tastes ok if one likes guava.
0	you can get this same product for .40 per can at petsmart ( when on sale , which is quite often ) , or .44 per can at walmart ; i.e. $ 9.60 for 24 cans at petsmart and $ 10.56 for 24 cans at walmart.
1	nice tea. i can steep up too 3 times. it has a strong cranberry flavor. probably would be good as a cold tea. i recommend if you love cranberry.
0	taste not the original one. flakes werent crispy. bad taste. best before &quot; feb 2013 &quot; .. ? implies that it is an old product. not happy .. returning it.
1	put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit.
1	my dogs have been eating this brand for a few years now and having found it available through amazon i am able to save money per pound and trips to the store. it arrives promptly and is the same quality as always. harmony farms is much easier to digest and healthier than most commercial foods. love it !
0	my 8 month old yellow lab destroyed the rope almost immediately. she also watched me fill it with toys and chewed on the screw off part until she broke the cover. then she chewed up the bottle. not for the heavy chewers like labs.
0	i received these march 24 , 2011 and it was not what is pictured. i got sweet pops. if i had wanted this kind i would have ordered them. in the box there was 19 cherry , 12 stawberry , 5 orange , 11 grape and 1 blue razz berry ... some assortment of flavors huh. very disappointed.
1	that &apos;s all i can say. yum at a great price ! i can &apos;t find these sizes anywhere in my local grocery so this is just awesome.
1	i don &apos;t know why my toddler is so crazy about these , but he is. he was snacking on so many cheerios every day that i was desperate to find something else that he would like but wouldn &apos;t require refrigeration , and this saved the day. i feel good about feeding him healthier snacks and he is positively in love with these !
0	i tried this lemon jell-o and it is the wors jell-o on the planet ! i woud never reccomend this jell-o i would reccomend the orange jell-o instead. the reason i gave it 2 stars is because i love jello in general. but not this jell-o.
1	one of the best peanut butter bars i &apos;ve ever had. the fruit jelly is so good and brings the whole thing together in a good snack or dessert.
0	just sweet , no flavoring that i could taste. while not expensive for what it is supposed to be , real expensive to use as sugar syrup. guess i &apos;ll stay with carnation flavored creamer. altho i really don &apos;t like to give nestle anything.
1	very nice product. it is not a mounds bar , but it helps satisfy the urge.
0	quite disappointed. the pills don &apos;t last that long ( it wears off after a few tries per pill ) and not all the food items on the suggested list works. e.g. cheese. maybe it was a bad batch , but i &apos;m not taking the risk to purchase it again.
0	the was a nasty tasting dinner , had not taste to and little hot. i will not purchase this type of dinner anymore. though hormel has other dinners i would purchase but not this one. there is zero ( 0 ) rating , would like a refund !
0	the packaging was very bad it arrived crushed. it was hardly eatable. do not buy from this site. it arrives all broken and in pieces. i would not recommend
0	i &apos;ve fgound the cure for drinking too much coffee inthe morning. get this one. i thought , when i first had this , that i had accidently wiped the sugar spoon with a mr clean cloth , but the next day , i had one cup of tully &apos;s and made the second cup , the green mountain breakfast blend. the disinfectant taste was back. i would not buy this one again.
1	we enljoy having loumidis greek coffee every day.iam an expert making the coffee. when my mother in law was alive she wanted to have greek coffee every day at four in the afternoon , so kept the trantition
0	i am disappointed in the quality of this and of the darjeeling loose teas. years ago when i used twinings regularly , it was of a higher quality. then i switched to murchie &apos;s of canada , excellent quality teas , and now i tried twinings again and am disappointed with it. it is acceptable , but not what i like in my teas.
1	i recommand this product. my childrens ( 5 and 3 ) love it , pouches as very usefull especially for breaks. to choose. enjoy
0	i &apos;ve read the reviews and i agree that yuban is absolutely the best coffee but at $ 100 for 12 cans comes to over $ 8 a can. that &apos;s $ 3 more a can than i pay at my local store. i don &apos;t understand the high price ?
0	i had damaged cans as well. eight of the 12 cans were very dented. the box was perfectly packaged and undamamaged.
1	it is very nice to be able to have biscuits again. i can only say they need to make a bigger box. we run out way to fast.
0	i consider my sheltie to be an intelligent dog , but the noise of the toy makes him back away. and i can &apos;t tell you how many times i &apos;ve &quot; demonstrated &quot; how to get the kibble out. he just waits until i do it. he could care less about the thing , and he &apos;s very food motivated.
1	i am very fond of citrus drinks to begin with , so maybe i am biased. but what i liked most about this was it wasn &apos;t too sweet and it is all natural. and it has a real citrus taste not a fabricated one. love it.
1	this product works wonders if you have stomach issues. i would buy again once i need more. : 0 )
0	i was so excited when i heard about this product. i love pork rinds. but these have a nasty chemical smell and they really don &apos;t taste good at all. don &apos;t waste your money. i actually threw the remaining 17 packages away. they really suck ! ! ! !
1	these chips are pretty delicious .. even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. it &apos;s not as delicious as doritos , but it &apos;s also not fried either , which definitely balances it out. a good snack for all times of day !
0	this is a great idea but just like baking a cake ... you can &apos;t do it in a midrowave.
1	this is great cheese , a little sharp yet creamy , with slight bits of crunchy. great with a micro brew. the merlot and raspberry are yummy too.
0	aweful , especially compared to their old four cheese queso , which our family loved. why would they drop the old four cheese ?
0	i was excited to see that amazon is selling 100 % kopi luwak. however , these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. i &apos;m guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag.
1	i really liked this drink. it provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet , sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind. despite containing apple and grape juice , it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises. if you &apos;re looking for a carbonated juice , i &apos;d definitely suggest this. i &apos;ll be drinking it again.
1	chewy chips ahoy and keebler soft batch are very similar taste and texture. i decided to try this since a had a coupon for 50 % off. they &apos;re slightly smaller than chips ahoy , but that &apos;s about it. my cookies arrived a little crumbled due to shipping , but no complaints because they were still edible and tasted great. great cookies , and now i have a stockpile of them : ) .
1	first of all , i love the packaging making it heatproof but it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were freakishly cold. i also want to thank veryasia for the free sample of mi goreng ... it was delicious ! ! ! i now love mi goreng.
1	i really like them , but they are sort of hard to put the lid on without crushing the cup. wish that was easier.
0	i can &apos;t believe that i got 5 whole pounds of this sour and old-tasting coffee.i might as well have bought a store brand of coffee !
1	the earths best he eats the most , this one is a little thicker than his original chicken / sweet potato favorite which is very runny.
0	at $ 11 i took a chance , expecting a 16oz or at least 12ox ... this is a 8.5oz and they do not disclose size in the produc description and conveniently obscure the size on the label.
1	grilled out brats , chicken , and burgers for the entire family yesterday. covered all of it with country bob &apos;s seasoning and all purpose sauce ! the family loved it. best sauce available ! ! can &apos;t wait to use it on my steaks tonight !
1	have been buying this product for over a year and &apos; max &apos; would eat it as fast as i could give it to him. however one or two drops at a time for a reward , is his limit ! yogurt is his favorite.
0	our company gave these as gives at a corprate party in february 2011. there were 20 handed out to exec. staff. by christmas , every one had died. i loved having coffee ready at my elbow whenever i wanted it , but it isn &apos;t worth the money for 8 months of convenience.
1	aboulutely love popchips ! i first tried these healthy chips at a marathon i did in california. i like this variety pack because i got to try alot of the flavors ive never had.
1	i tasted a few of these and they are pretty good. i was expecting something a bit flavorless and i can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike. i will write more after i have taken them on the trail.
0	what more can i say. barley edible - crunch on sugar. did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn &apos;t sell or maybe bad batch. doesn &apos;t make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth. kids probably don &apos;t care. hope this helps.
1	i make a &quot; jug &quot; of this tea every morning and keep a glass throughout the day. i &apos;m delighted to find a source in the us as it was introduced to me in b.c. it does not have the jasmine flavor which upsets my otherwise very strong tummy.
0	i tried many teas and thought would try this kind. saw it on dr. oz show. didn &apos;t like its taste.
1	they have this coffee at where i work ... and before this , they had this horrible folgers coffee which had to be diluted with sweetner and creamer ... i can actually drink this black because it &apos;s actually good ! it tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe , not just your coffee machine at home. good stuff.
0	our dogs liked them ok ... but ! ~ .... greenies dental chews for dogs , teenie pack , 96 chews .... they are pricey and our two pooches love .... veggi dental chews ... that &apos;s all we buy them now on amazon of course ! ~
1	i purchased these based on others recommendations. the rice cakes are delicious. thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. dense ... not full of air. i covered them with pb2 ( those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular pb and it tastes exactly the same ) . i too highly recommend these rice cakes.
1	this is amongst the best karachi halwa i have eaten. not rubbery or super chewy like a lot of the other ones ... just perfect .. individually wrapped pieces in the box.
0	regular flavor budda bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these.
0	you &apos;ll love this ! it tastes like medicine. it even coats your mouth the way medicine does. i absolutely love sparkling water of all types and think this is completely awful. it &apos;s not even like yummy grape-flavored cough syrup , more like liquid-death nyquil flavored. stay away.
0	thin , runny , and the fake milk powder used to add &quot; creaminess &quot; has an off flavor. better off eating your ceramic mug.
0	the tree is nice , but that is the only part besides the pot. did not come with a matching drip tray , as promised. instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper.
1	my son happily eats all of the fruit / veggie varieties of earth &apos;s best , unlike the organic baby products , none of which he likes at all. be careful to only get the fruit and veggie variety packs , not the dinner packs , as they have meat in them.
0	this iced tea is terrible. this is the first stash product that i do not enjoy. it is not iced tea. it tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
0	i used the minimum cup size to try and maximize the chocolate taste. this did not help but if you like a weak chocolate taste then you will like it.
1	i got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. to me , they taste just like corn nuts. they are quite hard , so i wouldn &apos;t recommend to anyone who doesn &apos;t like hard foods. they are crispy and delicious snacks tho. will buy more. : d
0	i ordered this because the title says ice cream and food sticks ... i received all ice cream. i don &apos;t have time to mess with a return. change the title if it &apos;s assorted ice cream.
1	i keep this at work and i mix in my smoothies at home- love it !
1	good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors ... a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
0	i received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. on the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. i will never buy liver treats from amazon again. big rip-off !
0	this is the third tasty bite entree i &apos;ve tried and the first i &apos;ve been truly disappointed in. the picture on the box is very misleading as the actual product is much soupier with much less solid substance. also , the taste of salt completely overpowers the taste of the lentils. i like the convienence of the packages and the nutrition so i &apos;ll probably try other tasty bite entrees - but not this one again !
0	these bags are very small. they are 67 cents each at the wal-mart. i should have done my homework first , but needed these in a hurry for a party.
1	i use vita coco coconut water with pineapple to mix with my ultra-meal nutritional supplement it mixes well and taste great.i have it for breakfast every morning.
1	i have never tasted any better ! need to keep refrigerated or it will lose color and flavor but is worth the price.
0	i &apos;ve used others that are better. if you &apos;re not careful you &apos;ll wind up with a lumpy sticky mess. try and mix this with the liquid prior to inserting it into the rice mixture.
0	i was not happy about the price of this single package item ! ! ! what a rip-off ! ! ! if you can , buy it from the store ... i was charged over $ 12 for a package that costs only $ 1.99- $ 2.50 in stores ... the problem is finding a store that carries this item
0	be careful ... even though this is listed under gluten free section it is not gluten free
1	i bought this tea based upon some research i had done into the ingredients and by reading the reviews posted here. this tea has a wonderful flavor and smell. i have enjoyed it very much and it helps me at bedtime with my sinus issues. great stuff !
0	i won &apos;t buy it again and will donate the whole box to the food bank.
0	given the reputation of the pepper , this sauce is heavily neutered. akin to the tabasco habenaro sauce. for the price , i expected the heat gods to a light my taste buds ... they didn &apos;t.
1	great for sushi , or for use with korean kim-bob , or maybe just as a snack. lightly salted , great crunch , and will support , rice , beef , pork , even fish. or a vegetable or two.
1	this is the very best marinade you can buy as far as i am concerned---of course , everyone to his or her own tastes , but all in all , i think anyone will like it---i give it five stars ...
1	not the best i &apos;ve ever had , but good. the best i &apos;ve had was expensive and from an english company ( i can &apos;t remember the name ) . but this is better than the movie kind. they &apos;re not quite as moist and rich as the best ones i &apos;ve tried.
0	i don &apos;t know what it was about this emeril &apos;s big easy blend , if perhaps there was a hint of chicory , but i really did not enjoy this style of coffee people k cup whatsoever. something was just off about it. i would try other flavors instead.
0	i purchased this item to celebrate the birth of my grandson. i should have opted for real cigars , they might have tasted better. these cigars were very hard and hurt my teeth to chew. not to mention that these gum cigars were much too sweet.
0	this coffee does smell wonderful ( mostly of raspberry and not so much the chocolate ) but it tastes weak to me. i usually prefer a donut shop taste ( middle of the road for boldness ) and was disappointed that this tasted a bit watered down. i will not be purchasing it again.
1	if this flavor lasted longer than it does , i &apos;d probably die of starvation for lack of wanting to take it out of my mouth.
1	its hard to find this stuff locally. usually my parents have to bring it to me when they visit. was pleased to find it on amazon. makes great , tasty dhall. we eat a lot of it , so its nice to know i can get it here again when i need it.
0	this tea was horrible. it tasted like potpourri. i have really enjoyed other davidson &apos;s teas , many also containing flowers , and thought to try something new. i think the last ingredient is where things went bad. it was &quot; natural flavor &quot; which must have been rose oil or something since my tea chemical taste and making a weaker tea did not help at all.
0	worked very little. sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter. a sour orange it did help. it didn &apos;t work on anything else at all.
1	got this to take along on backpacking trips with the horses. it works fine for that purpose , the size is perfect and worked like a charm. the two horses didn &apos;t attempt a getaway , at least. easy to put up and easy to take down , along with the portability makes this a camping winner !
0	dare changed their recipe , they are now called &quot; chocolate creme &quot; . i contacted dare they told me , they changed the box to make it more environmentally friendly and it &apos;s the same cookie because it has the same product number. i &apos;ve been eating this cookie for 30 years , i know what it tastes like , these new ones taste like &apos; oreos &apos; . very dissapointed.
1	got these luscious wine chocolates to use as part of my stocking stuffers. they were yummy and a big hit with everyone. would definitely buy again.
1	this tri-color couscous is really good ... full of flavor and fun to eat. i love the texture. i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs ( parsley , cilantro , ) along with some red pepper flakes. at the end of cooking , i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish ... highly recommend
1	the fennel smells fresh , tastes good , and makes a great addition to one of my tea blends. it is packaged exactly as shown in the picture. came in a timely manner. thanks !
0	can someone please tell me how the &quot; four net carbs &quot; on the amazon header page ( before you buy it ) translates into the 28 carbs on the outside of the box per bar once it arrives ? are we being lied to ?
1	we like plockys they like us. plockys plockys. mean no fuss. taste so good. and healthy too. plockys plockys. grab a bag or two. thank you plockys ! !
1	in my opinion these are heads and twos above any pickle that you normally find at your local grocery store. a lot of nice , sweet , pickle flavor. i probably won &apos;t buy again off of amazon because of shipping charges , but if i ever see them locally , i &apos;ll buy a bunch.
0	my recommendation ? get a juicer and make your own , or try odwalla. the taste was bitter , and the smell was strange and foul. the label says &quot; enriched with organic lemon juice &quot; and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. maybe it was the lemon i tasted , i don &apos;t know. i had about three sips and couldn &apos;t stomach it.
0	i was looking forward to this mix remembering wonderful swedish pancakes we used to have in va. unfortunately , this mix didn &apos;t produce anything close to that - they turned out to be a tasteless version of french crepes. the pancakes also had a vague smell of fish. considering that now i am stuck with 6 boxes , i am quite disappointed.
1	i have been looking for a nice strong rose tea , and this is the one ! i &apos;ve tried a number of brands , but they weren &apos;t &quot; rosy &quot; enough for me. this is an excellent tea with a strong rose flavor. no bitterness - nice and smooth. i highly recommend this tea !
0	our dog seems to like them and he chews them up fast so i don &apos;t know how much they actually clean. plus , sugar is listed as an ingredient ! are you serious ?
0	product is fine , everyone loves them , but i overpaid double the price. they are at sam &apos;s club for 8.99 for the same amount. never again
1	perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket. we love it. shakes well , no clumping and flows freely.
1	this sauce is good , but for my tastes it isn &apos;t hot enough. i have had other brands tht have a sleeper heat that makes the sauce multi layered. this sauce seems to ahve one layer.
0	this has to be without a doubt the worst tasting hot chocolate ever ! the best way to describe the taste of &quot; this stuff &quot; is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. swiss miss instant is way better and cost less. after only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this &quot; slop &quot; !
1	this was my second order of bit o honey. the first one arived with the celophane cut and one item missing. i hope mr. sticky fingers found the candy as enjoyable as i did.
1	this is definitely sweet , but that &apos;s how i like my wine. no backsweetening needed ! it has a pear flavor and chilled ... well , it &apos;s my favorite.
1	we have pancakes once a week and this is our go-to mix. it is incredibly easy to prepare , and i add a handful of chocolate chips , pieces of banana / strawberries / peach slices or whatever else people would like onto the individual pancake while it is cooking in the pan. no need to buy different flavors you can customize it yourself.
1	i was out to dinner with friends &amp; family at &quot; the saloon &quot; in &quot; rte 46 entertainment complex &quot; in sanford fl. besides having an awesome staff ( ask for keith ) and fabulous food ( the escargot is a must ) they serve china mist tea. this is the 1st time i chose the tropical organic green -- i have no doubt it is the best flavored tea i have ever had.
1	if you follow their recipes precisely , with careful measurements , the freezer jams are excellent. strawberry jam is particularly appealing. i &apos;ve been warned that changing quantities of any ingredient will not have happy results.
0	i think it is going to take an amazing coffee to get me away from my folger &apos;s classic roast and the occasional eight o &apos;clock vanilla. however , i understand that this coffee is meant for those who probably do not enjoy the aforementioned brands so keep that in mind when making your own coffee choices in life.
0	this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good
0	this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients. no real peppermint is in this product and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
0	i do not recommend these. my six month old golden retriever , who is not a strong chewer , devoured this in less than five minutes. it is a very expensive treat and i &apos;m just hoping we don &apos;t have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the edible nylabone. i will never buy these again ! ! !
1	so , i sampled this switch orange / tangerine blend. low on the carbonation , high on the orange taste , and worth every sip in gold ! plus , healthy to boot ... give it a try , and you may discard those &quot; brand names &quot; once and for all !
1	i enjoy it practically every evening , it is very good popcorn , not as much hulls and small when popped.
1	exactly what i wanted ... individual packages of cookies that i couldn &apos;t find at a store. shipping was only 99cents and came to be in about 3 days. it was great !
0	after opening numerous bags i found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen ?
1	i got these salts for my boyfriend who loves to cook and love his salt ! the stand they come in is wooden and sturdy , much nicer than i expected ! the salts themselves are phenomenal and i have already bought the 2nd set !
1	my husband and i fell in love with cafe britt coffee while we were in costa rica. upon our return we were delighted to see that we could order it through amazon.com ! the coffee is easy to drink - not bitter or harsh and is a great way to start your day. highly recommended.
0	i ordered 3 boxes of 18 each ............. and opened one box to find they were pods and not for keurig , and i can &apos;t return them ! ! ! ? ? ? ? ? yes , the pods fit into the keurig but the end product is weak and awful. i am most disappointed
0	yes , i tasted them - they taste like chemicals but i guess that &apos;s what you should expect from a joint supplement. my shih tzu &amp; pekingese would not eat them.
0	i have bought several revolution flavored teas .. white pomegranate and sweet ginger peach ( not sweet but nice peachy ginger taste ) and i loved them. however , this tea is not too good .. there is no pear flavor ! not even a subtle one .. it is a bit bitter and really just like a plain white tea. if you like that , fine , but don &apos;t expect a pear taste !
1	i always enjoy jello pudding , however , one package that i recieved was opened , and the powder spilled all over. it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24.
1	this sauce is so good with just about anything , i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles , it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it
1	it &apos;s balanced , it &apos;s tasty , it &apos;s filling , it &apos;s good for you -- what more could you ask of a breakfast cereal ? i still miss kellogg &apos;s sister product , just right , which was a somewhat lighter blend ( i loved it , they discontinued it ) , but mueslix is a strong second-best.
1	i have a whole box of peanut butter dog cookies and she wont touch them. she loves these and begs for them so it was a good buy. she is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her mouth. about 20 per box.
1	love the chips , nice 100 + / - calorie snack , reminds me of munchos , but less greasy , flavors are good ( salt &amp; vinegar least favorite ) . and they &apos;ve started shipping apo--thank you and my family thanks you ( so they don &apos;t have to get the package and reship ! ) made my day.
0	this is an okay gift box , only if you like mediocre cheese and summer sausage. the items are small , smaller than they appear in the picture. i only paid $ 30 , but i would not purchase it again. on the positive side , the mustard samples that come with it make the items edible.
1	my daughter &apos;s kindergarten class celebrated chinese new year and we were in charge of providing the fortune cookies. this company had a prompt delivery and the cookies were a great success. her teacher commented on how funny the fortunes were for the kindergartens.
0	the ones i received were mostly yellowish in color with some light green instead of dark green , dry and somewhat stale , they may have been in a warehouse longer that they should have !
1	this popcorn leaves very few old maids. it &apos;s fresh , so the kernels pop as bi as they should ( unlike some other brands i &apos;ve purchased ) . my only criticism is that there are lots of hulls. but of the three brands of popcorn i &apos;ve recently bough for use in my microwave popcorn popper , it &apos;s the best.
0	arrives $ 15.06 postage due in a used friendly &apos; s box. unfriendly don &apos;t you think ? worst service ever ! ! ! ! ! _ totally unfriendly ! ! ! ! aweful aweful aweful service !
0	i had received a sample of the mandarin spice and it was so good. i ordered this and definately not the same. tasteless. i will go back to the tea bags.
0	personal preference ... too sweet. tastes like general foods international coffees. price is great if you like that , though. and makes up very easy.
1	i hated stevia and it &apos;s licorice taste until i tried nustevia. since that day , i have almost completely eliminated sugar in my drinks. i like that it is a plant based product and not bio-engineered. no after-taste and you need very little to make anything taste sweet.
1	this product is like orange juice that is fizzy. it reminds me of another product , izze , but this product is slightly sweeter and isn &apos;t as carbonated as izze. i would recommend this product , just make sure it is cold because it tasted alot better cold than warm.
1	i prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. they are the perfect compliment to a hamburger , steak or chicken entree. try them. you &apos;ll like them !
1	this candy is amazing ! great tasting chocolate and caramel and still sugar free. i wish it was for sale locally , but am happy i get a chance to purchase online.
1	mine came with a wine soaked variety thats purple - i haven &apos;t tried yet , the cheddar is delicious and melts smoothly ... marigold ( actually has marigold bits in it ) - very nutty , earthy soooo tasty my favorite so far and the bouche de chevre -mmm runny creamy delicious ! i have never been disappointed by any of the igourmet cheese selections even if its different than pictured this is no different !
0	this tea has no flavor , tastes like dust it &quot; looks &quot; like quality -- pretty package -- but it &apos;s no good. lipton regular pekoe is farrr superior.
1	we only like white popcorn and since it &apos;s hard to find in the grocery store it &apos;s great to order this. it was yummy and plentiful ! recommend !
1	this is the perfect gift with a southwestern flair. the jelly &apos;s were of decent size , the spreader is a nice quality piece with a small glass chili pepper attached. cute little bag - great gift for the price !
1	i don &apos;t know what to say that others have not covered. if you like potato chips you will like these. get em on sale when you can and limit your intake ... if you can ...
1	tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run ... unbelievably awesome. tasted great , no stomach issues , no sticking to my teeth , water not required to &quot; wash it down &quot; and most importantly - it was the best run i &apos;ve had in a long time. can &apos;t wait to try other flavors.
1	listen if you want a good taste and hot. this the stuff ! it won &apos;t melt your eyes out .but it is too hot to take straight . one dab will do ya on a bite of pizza !
1	i got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn , wheat , potatoes , flax , fish , and pork. i had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn &apos;t allergic to. i &apos;m so glad i found this food. he is finally eating and starting to put on some weight. it is a little pricey but i think it is worth it for such a good product.
1	i bought this for my 1 year old and he loves it just as much as the other organic brands we &apos;ve purchased , but i got this one for 30-50 % less ! great buy.
1	beautiful clear reddish in the cup and delicious with no off taste or &quot; bite &quot; . recommended without hesitation. just opened the bag , and i &apos;m ordering some more already.
1	can &apos;t go wrong with this. remember its jingle : &quot; better coffee a millionaire &apos;s money can &apos;t buy ! &quot; always priced right and in this economy that &apos;s not always easy. frankly i prefer it over starbucks where one can easily spend the same amount on one cup of coffee !
1	have bought this from the folks who prepare it and i must say , this is the absolute best item i have ever tasted. they make this at a farm in benson , az and it tastes like heaven. highly recommend it for everything ... i tend to slice up apples and dip them. have tried it on toast as well.
0	no doubt this is great if you are on a diet and need sugar-free but this stuff taste so artificial and the coloring is way too strong. the sweetness leaves a strange unbearable aftertaste. i &apos;m stuck with 20 tiny boxes and i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll order these again.
1	i &apos;ve tried many different brands of virginia peanuts but these are far and away the best. i &apos;ve turned my entire family on to this brand and they &apos;ve ordered them also. they &apos;re superb.
0	the happy baby beef stew was not much of a beef stew. the second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product. it didn &apos;t seem to have even a trace taste of beef. because of the high tomato content , the stew was very acidic. i was a bit disappointed by this product.
0	i buy a lot of canned salmon , smoked and not. this time , i wanted a wild-caught version to avoid carcinogenic chemicals. as soon as i opened the can , a powerful fishy smell took over the kitchen , more powerful than sardines. the taste is overly fishy also. maybe it was a bad can. if the rest are better , i &apos;ll write another review.
1	these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack , and really satisfying with the tomato
0	this toy does not entice my pet at all. i am &quot; underwhelmed &quot; and actually regret purchasing it. i could have spent my money better purchasing nylabones which my pet loves.
1	i have been drinking this green tea for sometime and was purchasing it when i was going to syracuse every summer. this year i stopped going there and didn &apos;t know where i was going to buy my tea until i spotted it on amazon and purchased it. i was so pleased that i could get it , so i am now a happy camper once again.
1	the energy drink is a great product. the shipping price is crazy tho. i paid more for the shipping then both products together , so not a great deal.
1	the cookie is crispy good and flavorful. the fortunes are thoughtful , not the shallow ones we are seeing lately. ( be patient , even in time an egg will walk ) i received the quantity and quality i ordered.
1	i love these chips , they taste so good i am on a low cal diet and they are perfect. the individual bags keep you honest. thank you popchips
1	i got these for my gf as she isn &apos;t supposed to eat any gluten. all of the flavors taste great and they seem to be much healthier than regular potato chips. if you are looking for a gluten-free snack , i highly recommend popchips !
0	i used the small cup setting and even opened up the cap and scraped the excess mix out of the cup and it is still very weak tasting.
0	i &apos;ve been looking at this holder since i saw it at the at my office. today i found it at bb &amp; b for $ 24. it works great but too expensive at amozon.
1	definitely would reorder these again. i think it would be better if they were offered in a bigger pack. my kids love these. great little valentine &apos;s day gifts. great stocking stuffers.
1	they are good but wish they were also baked. have not found baked no salt potato chips anywhere. if there are any i wish someone would post.
1	put two tablespoons. in a large cup of fresh coffee and you have a great coffee mocha. i have recently tried several others that have been recommended and got great customer reviews online. none are as good as this one.
1	this jelly tastes heavenly. you wont find anything this good at the grocery store. all i can say is i &apos;ll be ordering more shortly.
0	seems very weak. i must be honest , i ordered the wrong coffee. i was sad. this isn &apos;t bad as a base for an iced coffee.
0	i like creamy peanut butter , however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. kinda makes for a messy sandwich.
1	wagyu beef is a kobe beef japanese cow crossbred with an american cow. it &apos;s the best possible beef you can get in the us and is not illegal.
1	i use this product every time i shower and it is great. i usually get horribly dry skin in the winter but this along with dove lotion keeps my skin soft and smooth ! the smell is good , not overwhelming and you get alot of product , the bottle is huge. very comparable to department store body washes ( i have kiehls , chanel , and shiseido ) except a lot more affordable.
1	i have not tried this product personally , but my dog has , and he loves it , and is aging well. he &apos;s getting a bit grey , but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago.
1	i &apos;m not normally a big fan of mixes but this is a great waffle mix. it &apos;s quick , easy , and produces delicious waffles. yes , it &apos;s pricier than some of the other mixes on amazon but i think it &apos;s worth it.
1	love pg tips tea. it &apos;s hard to find in the usa , but a standard in the uk.
0	don &apos;t waste your money on any of the kettle brand potato chips. i bought a case of these , and a case of the cheddar and sour cream. both cases ended up in the garbage can.
0	i was excited to try this sauce after reading the reviews. i was very disappointed in the flavor of the marinade. if you like a smokey flavor than this is for you. i was hoping for a fajita flavor.
0	very bitter and not nearly as thick as expected. very runny , actually. there are better brands out there.
0	i was so excited to find these again after all these years and i had ordered them a few months ago. when i received this package , it was different and had a very distinctive smell. i tasted some of one and had to throw the whole box away. careful when purchasing ...
0	i was a bit dismayed that there wasn &apos;t an expiration date on the box or on any of the individual packages. the popcorn tasted great for about 3 weeks and then it just tasted stale. gross , i had to throw out over half of the product.
1	i never in my life tasted such a good babka its crazy good ! this is the real babka ! that my gram mother use to make
1	these are definitely the best chocolate raisins out there. they are the perfect balance of chocolate and raisin ... and my boyfriend won &apos;t have any others. too many brands have a ton of chocolate around an itty bitty raisin. what &apos;s the point ? these are great and a treat !
0	i threw this away after about a week of ownership. couldn &apos;t get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over , and half the time , i couldn &apos;t get it off at all. it only works for long stemmed herbs , and all need to be about the same height.
0	i tried these for a substitute for a sandwich roll , i couldn &apos;t cut them without falling apart ! i ended up toasting them in pieces , more like chunks , and with enough cream cheese , they were only ok ! tapioca hamburger rolls are the only products i would recommend !
1	this is a real good product.i love these chips and so does my customers can &apos;t go wrong wit these the best
1	there are 4 kittens that started hanging outside the house and i started feeding them. rather than buying the smaller bags , this is a great value for multiple cats. the kittens love the food and always look forward to eating it. shipped right to your door. can &apos;t go wrong with that !
1	my 1 year old son does really like these- andthey certainly taste better than some of the other finger food snacks. the only issue is there are lots of crumbs in the can they come in , so it gets messy if you want to dump them into a baggie for on the go.
1	my dog is really &quot; picky &quot; when it comes to his food and i usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days &quot; until he will eat &quot; his new food. i opened the bag when my order arrived and gave my dog a taste ...... he loved his new food &amp; this is his second 15 pound bag !
1	these taste good - kind of like cherry koolaid. 95 % organic ingredients make it a bit healthier than koolaid. better than the clif bloks ( i say that b / c the cola clif bloks have a medicinal after taste ) .
1	i bought this with the presto 04830 powerpop microwave multi-popper back in july and have been very , very pleased. almost no kernels left in the bottom and fluffy , large popcorn. getting ready to reorder so i thought i would pass it on. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b00005ibxk &quot; &gt; presto 04830 powerpop microwave multi-popper &lt; / a &gt;
1	this is very good hot chocolate , creamy and tasty. all of the flavors are good , my favorite is the peppermint. i wish the peppermint was available on its own , not in the variety pack. my son and i also like to add peppermint flavored marshmallows , for an extra shot of peppermint taste. in my opinion , better than the swiss miss k-cups.
1	this product allows me to make some really big splashes when providing spiced nuts at gatherings. the fact that the gold spreads so easily allows me to use just a little but &quot; show off &quot; people are amazed that this is edible gold
1	we are always pleased with amazon &apos;s packaging. chips are never crushed or broken , always fresh. we really liked this brand / flavor of chips. very tasty !
1	my 8 year old great dane was itching a lot with the lamb meal from the big box stores. i started buying this ( for cheaper ) and he stopped itching. his coat is also looking shinier. i wish i would have discovered this years ago. it saves me trips to the pet store and money also.
0	my triplets will not eat this , eventhe one who will eat anything. the consistency is way too runny as well and does not stay on the spoon.
0	hi , i am very disappointed with the past shipment i received of the one coconut water. 3 of the boxes were leaking and the coconut water was spoiled. thanks. laks
0	it was a real pain to throw out the whole bag ..... but it was too disgusting to open .... beware. i am a huge fan of kirkland products-but this was not worth opening to try. my local costco doesn &apos;t sell this.
1	could only find at local shell gas station ...... now i have a source to buy all i want ! fast &amp; secure delivery .... price is great ! will order again , and again , etc. , .....
0	this vendor is unscrupulous. she ripped off her cultures from other collectors and shamelessly claims them as her own. she has no conscience and i would highly recommend that you do your purchasing elsewhere.
0	cannot detect any difference from other ghees. also , their supposed &apos; free &apos; sample is not really. they ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about $ 2.00 in postage , something for the box and it costs you $ 4.99. very disappointed. they should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings.
0	product looks nothing like the picture it has only one small branch nowhere in product description does it say it needs a humidity tray and special fertilizer when you get the plant then it says immediately contact us to get these needed products.i will not purchase from this vendor again
1	i eat mustard with everything , this is hands down the best mustard i have ever tried , in fact everyone i tell to try some , falls in love with it as well. spicy , tasty , real quality. if you like spicy mustard , you will love this.
1	these are wonderful ! but , they are small , so i usually eat 2 at at time. and ... will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper. so , i keep them in the fridge. love them ! !
0	my spouse found the syrups to be weak and artificial so that we disposed of the bulk of the shipment.
0	happy that i checked the ingredients ! this dog food is not vegan ! it has d3 instead of d2 added to it. too bad ...
0	i wanted this for the omega 3 &apos;s but my daughter wouldn &apos;t eat this. it really smells and looks like cat food.
1	i like the dessert delights line , and this is one of their better flavors. but the carton i received contains only packs that are stale. the sticks are stiff and difficult to chew , and the flavor disappears within 10 minutes. i &apos;m quite disappointed that they would dump old products on their customers.
1	a great pick-me-up when exerting energy. i eat these while biking. honey base is apparent in the after-taste , but isn &apos;t over-powering. the chews are great-tasting and provide energy without caffeine.
1	these are delicious. my husband and i just love them. especially the bbq and salt and vinegar flavors. i like the individual packages. it &apos;s a wonderful bargain when you get free shipping !
1	it has good tast and crunchy. i bought black sesame before , it is good too. highly recommanded.
1	i order these peas and they came fast. the product has a good flavor and i am very happy with the peas. i will order with them again
1	love these little peanut butter dipped granola bars. they are delicious. they are only one point on the weight watchers points system. even you were not dieting , these bars are a great and filling snack.
1	if anyone is looking for delicious and healthy snack , doctor kracker is an answer. however , the hard crispiness is for people with good teeth.
1	arrived very quickly and packaged safely. they are vacuumed sealed and then put within a thick plastic ziplock bag. even with the packaging i could smell the vanilla when i opened my ups box. there are so many beans in here , a very great buy for my homemade vanilla extract ! !
1	i &apos;m giving this product 5 stars because i think it is great considering that it is made with water. the hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size. if you want a large cup of hot chocolate , use 2 k-cups. it is fairly low in calories , most likely because artificial sweeteners are necessary to get all the ingredients into the little k-cup.
1	i keep a stack of these tuna cups at work , along with lemon juice and teriyaki sauce for variety. they are low calorie , satisfying , and nutritious. i &apos;m sold on them-- now buy in bulk and keep on hand all the time !
0	i used to buy these canisters at walmart for $ 8 each. at $ 19.98 his ends up being $ 3.33 a gallon ! buy the packets instead. i &apos;ve gotten the 6 gallon packets by the case and it ends up being $ 1.75 a gallon ! or buy the 1 gallon packets for $ 1.85 each. much better bargan.
1	i feed my 10 year old toy breed this food and she hasn &apos;t complained yet. was feeding her eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare. switched then to only organic brands like wellness. this product has been the best deal on organic dog food i have found and with the subscribe and save ... perfect ! !
1	the best sugar substitute at this time. swerve is virtually replacing sugar in our home. bakes and measures the same as sugar with no aftertaste. can &apos;t wait for it to go mainstream to be able to buy in our supermarkets.
1	i &apos;m not much of a candy eater but these suckers are fantastic. sweet and long lasting. my whole family is addicted to this great treat
0	stay away ! ! ! ! you have been warned. this is the most foul tasting rubber you wil ever try. i am sorry i was forced to give it 1 star.
0	after confirming that the receipt of one bag was not an error , i was able to get a partial credit.
1	the only thing keeping this product from five stars are all of the broken shells. at the top of the bag , i found a number of half shells. however , when i got to the bottom i realized that many of the seeds had collected there in a pile of shell remnants and seasoning salt. blow the seasoning off and you may lose some seeds as well. otherwise , a great eating experience.
0	this product sells for $ 4.69 in new york city , the bronx and in south jersey ( in shoprite ) for $ 4.69 a can. amazon is selling it for over five dollars a can , and you have to buy the case. get it at the store. the formula is great just amazon has it over priced
0	the taste of this almond milk is so off that i cannot even finish the carton that i purchased. i prefer blue diamond original almond milk
1	when i stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs , i was intrigued enough to order them. i do enjoy grapefruit flavors and i love tic tacs with intense flavors. these did not disappoint. they offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruit. an unusual treat !
1	i had brought this as a dipping sauce for dumplings and egg rolls i made at home. it taste &apos;s great and i think it the same sauce i get at some thai places cause it tastes the exact same.
0	these pop chips are satisfying and good for a snack , but not what i expected. they do not taste as good , crisp or as light as the weight watchers brand that is so hard to find in stock. i wish amazon could carry the actual weight watcher &apos;s brand chips - they are the best snack out there.
1	this is a very good snack and good for you. price was good. shipping not bad , but good for distance.
1	it is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies ! just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt-in-your-mouth good !
0	most of the nuts in these bags were so old they had turned black totally worthless will never order again
1	this is a great product. great flavors and very fresh. i received it quickly and damage free. it is my opinion that this is a great value and i highly recommend it.
0	caused my cuisinart k-cup brewer to leak every time i used it. great idea , just needs some adjustments so that the coffee maker works properly with it.
1	this arrived earlier than expected , which was great ! however , for some reason , this particular product smelled a little like &quot; fish food &quot; .... but no worries , still tasted like great cashew butter , just the smell was kinda weird - like fish food. also , i wish this product was organic.
1	i love this stevia ! i have tried many different kinds over the years and this one is my fave ! goes great in my coffee and tea. i have this one on auto ship and get one a month ( makes it pretty cheap too ! )
0	tasteless , basically says it all. i love tea. drink it every day. i found this undrinkable. great packaging , but not a good tea for me.
0	i did not think pb2 tasted like true peanut butter , then i figure out why , it has sugar added. i guess for people who like sugar added to peanut butter will like it , but i do not like it. i don &apos;t get it take out 85 % of the fat and add sugar. why ? ? hopefully waiting for them to take out the sugar.
1	not too sweet. the best k-cup hot chocolate i &apos;ve tried thus far. the kids loved drinking and making the hot chocolate.
1	i &apos;ve made these twice in cupcake form , topped with red jam and powdered sugar. of course it doesn &apos;t taste like a normal vanilla cake ... more grainy in texture , with a subtle sweetness , and some spice. but i think they are super tasty. they didn &apos;t suffer from the weird chewy texture i often run into with rice-flour based mixes. also used energ egg replacer with no problem.
0	my dogs love to chase pop bottles so i thought they would love these so much i ordered one for each of them. they don &apos;t even look at them. one figured out how to get the treats out but still isn &apos;t interested.
0	i have tried and enjoyed the switch black cherry flavor , but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired. to my palate , the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y , not very pleasant. i appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda ( basically carbonated water and fruit juice ) , but they need to get the flavor right.
1	this hot chocolate tasted very good ! the whole family liked it ! ! ! it is a nice change to make hot chocolate instead of coffee inthe keurig coffee maker. we wold purchase this again.
1	prior to switching to newman &apos;s own organics dog food , my 4 year old shih-tzu was crunching on iams. which was fine , except that every 2-3 months or so he &apos;d have stomach problems. after switching , his poops have been firmer , no stomach issues in sight , and his coat has gotten glossier ( and much less flaky ) . duncan likes his new food and so do i !
1	good beans. i can &apos;t find these in the grocery stores where i live , but ordered them through this retailer with no problems.
0	i wouldn &apos;t buy these again. they are way to sweet , not fling , and do nothing to curb appetite. not sure what i expected of these but i would not buy them again. there are far better products out there for the price.
0	in the description of the tea it lists all organic ingredients. the tea i received only one of the ingredients is organic. i will say that amazon was awesome in responding and refunding. but i do think this tea should not be listed as organic.
1	i found out about these from a co-worker. they are delicious , low calorie , and pack some protein. eating these rather than my usual pretzels and chips helped me slim down. i get them by the case now from amazon since it is a better buy ( and my supermarket doesn &apos;t always carry them ) .
1	these are quite tasty and delicious , i love them .... but the prices here are ridiculous ! ! ! did i say ridiculous ? oh so ridiculous ! ! ! but im here to rate the product not the price ... 5 stars for the product.
1	this like yummy homemade hot cocoa , with the benefit of being a delicious cup of coffee , too ! this is a great deal ! get it while it lasts ! good to the last drop , you could say ! enjoy !
1	awesome idea ! i couldn &apos;t find my husband &apos;s favorite coffee in the k-cups , so i bought these to make my own. works great with loose leaf teas too.
0	i am not trying to be mean or anything but these cookies very very dry and tasted very unpleasant.
0	somehow my previous review got deleted. i live in houston , tx. i buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of talking rain and a glass of cold tap water.
0	my dog wouldn &apos;t even touch it. however from what i &apos;ve heard other people use it. it seems way too heavy and bulky for a dog to play with and i can see if causing a lot of damage to your furniture if your dog was to swing this around. especially if you have a small child that could get whipped in the head with it.
0	although the description said 3 large packets , i only received one. it was wrinkled and worn ; i would not feel good about giving it as a gift. i contacted the supplier directly to try and resolve the issue , and never received a response. needless to say , i was very disappointed with this purchase , and would never buy from this supplier again.
1	delicious. i cannot get australian ginger where i live. this compares favorably to australian ginger i &apos;ve purchased in other cities. now i can enjoy it without traveling.
0	for some reason merrick thinks this product is worth double now ! i bought two 8 lb bags early september and came back to buy the next batch only to notice the price has been hiked a whole 100 % from $ 8.xx to now almost $ 17 ! just gonna transition my dog off this brand and move on to another company that actually has consistency in pricing !
1	the parisian cafe blend is wonderful but it is too thick to fit correctly in the senseo machine. the box advertises universal fit but it is not.
1	this soup is pretty good , not great ! i put some heavy cream ( 1-2 oz ) and some tabasco in it. i have had a lot better lobster bisque - but at a much higher price ...
1	these are super tastey ! i would definitely recommend. the only reason i &apos;m not giving 5 stars is because i wish they were bigger ! : d
0	in the past i &apos;ve bought these from a local grocery store and they were soft , chewy , moist , and delicious. unfortunately the batch i just received from amazon were dried out , crunchy , and stale. wondering if the boxes sold here are expired overstock. buyer beware - food items can not be returned. am hesitant to try again ...
1	i tried this chips in a hotel that i stayed at , and loved them ! i ordered them for the office and everyone enjoyed them. i &apos;m on my second order !
0	received product timely. upon opening product found weevil infestation. put product in freezer to kill weevils. returning product would have been a nuisance.
0	this is the worst energy drink i ever tasted. it has a really big spicy flavor to the drink. the spicy to the drink over powers it and its impossible to even finish one out six. i even tried giving the other five away for free and people would do the same thing i did throw it away. so i really spent about $ 19.00 down the drain.
1	i couldn &apos;t find the gum at the grocery store. so i ordered it from amazon. the order came quickly and the gum was great !
0	i ordered twinings green gunpowder with mint. without notice i recieved regular not with mint which is nothing like i ordered.
1	amazing concept ... not fried , not even baked ... popped like popcorn ... ! ! ! ! this is another product for my weight watchers regima. each bag is only 2 points .. i love this snack for mid morning in between breakfast and lunch. they taste really good .. my favorite are the bar-b-que , salt &amp; vinegar , and the sour cream .. they are all good though.
0	mine came tasting old. it was in transit for 5 days in the heat. i like this product but do not get it in the mail especially in the summer time.
1	i love the convenience of the singles. the best creamer around.taste is just like the big bottle. i can stick them in my purse and take them to work.
1	i am very satisfied with my twizzler purchase. i shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them. i will definitely be ordering more.
1	these are the most consistent soy crisps i have had. they are light , flavorful , and always fresh - and usually arrive in very good condition ( not crumbs ) . they are a bit salty , but that &apos;s the only point that might be bad - just depends on what you &apos;re expecting.
0	this gum is crumbly and the lackluster flavor fades faster than any gum i &apos;ve ever chewed. it &apos;s gone in around 10 seconds.
0	this product smells so bad that i couldn &apos;t even try to consume it. it smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened. the seller has a no return policy so i &apos;m out the $ i spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.
1	i thought this coffee was really good , but i think the next time i order , i will order something a bit stronger.
0	this was very pricey for what is essentially a small bag of hard crumbs. maybe my dog is just spoiled , but she treats these like third class treats- it is definitely on the bottom of the doggie treat hierarchy. more often than not , she will simply walk away from these. glad other people like them , but i will not be buying them again.
0	this is a good decaf coffee , but i &apos;ve never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. it &apos;s extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.
1	everyone knows what a tic tac is , but let me tell you something ; if you like orange tic tac &apos;s , you &apos;re going to love wild cherry tic tacs ! very cherry flavored with just enough of a mix of sweet and sour. do yourself a favor and try some.
1	thank god they finially made them i can &apos;t always afford the buy the regular k-cups. the only change i would make is to have peel and stick top for them. the peel and sticks could have your own name on them so you could share them with your friends. ron
0	there is nothing metallic about this color. it is gold in the fact that it is yellow , but that is it. there isn &apos;t any sheen or sparkle. i was bummed.
0	my pug almost died from this product. a piece did not digest and got stuck in his intestinal tract. he had to have emergency surgery and 3000.00 later is now ok. any knowledgeable pug breeder will tell you not to feed these to your pug. all the company did was refund me 25.00 for the cost of the product.
0	i &apos;m a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill. imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have the switch. i had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it &apos;s anything but refreshing.
0	came with an expiration date of 1 month ! ! ! ! amazon need to not send out bad products or not sell them at all
1	very smooth and i used my own filters. the smell is so inviting , i used my own measurements because it was not on the package. i used l tblsp. per cup and i worked out fine for me , i like my coffee tasteful.
1	i &apos;ve never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches ; starkist and chicken of the sea. i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning.
1	i don &apos;t know why , because it doesn &apos;t look very appetizing , but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon.
1	great product and great scheduled deliveries. i get it for my youngest son , who lives in a group home. not sure what they do with it all , but at least he &apos;s clean !
1	only 5mg sodium per serving , chips are crisp. i sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor.
1	my husband and i really like this cocoa. i add extra milk to my cup for a creamier flavor , but the convenience cannot be beat.
1	flour type 00 is better than regular flour. whether frying it or baking it , dough maintains softness and pliability. i like it a lot.
1	i keep this on hand for the young at heart. we enjoy a cup almost every night. good taste. will buy again.
1	the best sauce on the market. we use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
0	this was just not my cup of tea - er , i mean coffee ( har har ) . it had a sharp , acrid taste to it , and left a bitter aftertaste. i &apos;m not a coffee connosisseur by any means , but i know what i like and i know what i don &apos;t like , and i don &apos;t like this. i would not recommend it , especially with so many other keurig coffee options.
0	i purchased the product for a christmas gift and assumed that coming from bellagio it would be perfect. the person i gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away. she said it smelled great but tasted chalky and wouldn &apos;t drink any more of it.
0	not strong enough for the first cup in the morning. i need something strong to wake me up. maybe i should have found a stronger blend
0	i bought this brand and it was just horrible. amazon needs to source and offer 3 ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.
1	they taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. the meat was of high quality. i was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. rather , these are about 6 small fillet in a can , much more like sardines are packaged ( but these are just fillets ) . was a bit disappointing for that , and the info could have been more clear.
1	these chips are tasty and low in calorie. if you are gluten free they are a great option as a to-go snack. we love them.
0	they refuse to ship this fine tea to canada. i have to go to the middle east to find it and bring it back.
0	i will not buy this product again. i cannot find the actual ingredients , natural and other flavors are not sufficient for people with allergies. so far the peppermint is ok if i do not buy the minis. i may just stop buying wrigley products in general when finding ingredient lists is this difficult.
1	my 18 month old grandson only eats organic foods , and i was looking for a treat to give him when he visits. he loves these candies , and i don &apos;t feel too guilty because they are in a tiny packet with only a few in each one. they stay at grandma &apos;s and grandpa &apos;s house ! ( of course we brush his teeth afterwards. )
1	this is a great mix. i mixed it with milk instead of water. just follow the directions.
1	this is the best licorice ever ! or at least the best i &apos;ve ever had or can conceive of. the only problem is that now that my 12-pack is gone , it &apos;s hard to concentrate on my work as i go through panda withdrawal and cannot think of anything but panda.
1	i purchased cafe excellence crazy caramel , flavored whole bean coffee it has a very good flavor and would buy again and the price was great
1	these are really great tasting cookies. i like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate. a nice change from the usual chocolate chip cookies.
1	these cookies were fun to paint but not too tasty to eat ! the kids did not really care much , but it might have been more fun if they could have eaten them. they really had fun coloring them !
0	very easy to use not the best flavor it has too much sugar and is not a quality i thought i was getting
1	i made the recipe on the package and my family loved this dish. i will make it many , many times. my grandson said he wanted a whole dishful just for himself !
1	i love this coffee. very dark but not at all bitter. i finally found one i like as much as jet fuel.
0	even with small containers , they don &apos;t fill them up. these little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares ? or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transport. can manufacturers be honest in their dealings ?
1	great taste , texture , flavor , and works well with any recipe ! wonderful pricing , too ! gluten free products are so expensive normally ! definitely recommend this !
1	these ginger cookies are it ... i don &apos;t have to look anymore ... i have found the cookie ... i ate the entire box and did not share ... so hubby said when i order more i have to get 2 boxes cause he would like to have some .. : )
0	i tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled oj but fizzier. maybe it would be an acquired taste but i won &apos;t be drinking it again to find out. oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.
0	i ordered the product and thought i was getting the large size. i called the shipper , no returned calls and i can &apos;t really use the item shipped as i needed the large item. how do i return , the shipper doesn &apos;t return the calls. not a happy customer of this product.
1	i drank this and could tell very little difference from a regular orange / tangerine flavored soda , which is quite impressive considering that this drink is made from 100 % juice ! it has 140 calories and a great alternative to a regular soda. i will definitely be purchasing these in the future ! i also tried their kiwi strawberry carbonated juice and enjoyed it as well.
0	are you kidding me ! $ 32.00 ! ! ! i buy this all day long at popular wholesale clubs for under $ 10.00. no more then $ 15.00 at reqular stores. watch these prices guys.
1	i love vitamuffins , but my supermarket sells one box of 4 muffins for $ 6.29. instead i bought the mix , 3 boxes for $ 16.00 , and each box makes 12 muffins. instead of $ 1.62 per muffin , the mix only requires water &amp; eggs and works out to about 48 cents per muffin , and very easy to make. that &apos;s a great deal.
0	do not fed your dog any happy hip = dogswell product - it is not safe - google it if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work
0	these cookies are small , grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. and very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. might be great for multiple allergies , but i was very disappointed.
1	we have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach. we have tried several kinds of dog food for her and newman &apos;s own organic seems to be agreeing with her. so we will continue purchasing this product through amazon as long as it does.
1	these chips are fanfreakintastic. they are with out a doubt the best chips that i have ever had. a nice sweet smoky flavor and then a little bit-o-heat. oh ya baby.
1	ordered this goat cheese and it is just fantastic ! i can &apos;t digest cow milk so finding these goat cheeses was a great treat ! i would order them again they are that delicious ! looks spectacular on a cheese platter with fruit and selected crackers.
1	this powder , and this company , are both superb. there was a small problem with the order and they handled it in such a gracious manner that i will be a customer forever.
1	great product , nice combination of chocolates and perfect size ! the bags had plenty , and they were shipped promptly. the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies !
1	i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor. the regular is fine with brown sugar added. the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok. this is a very quick , easy and satisfying breakfast and i &apos;ll order this brand again , but not the variety. i &apos;ll get all maple and brown sugar.
1	i was amazed at the actual taste of this product . . . the amount of protein and the lack of fat is really good. they have a lot more flavors and all of the combinations are really good.
1	strawberry twist has a long-lasting pleasant flavor sweet-but , not excessively so. delivery is timely and price is just right. supieror to other trident flavors ! though , spearmint isn &apos;t bad either. my next pick would be blueberry
0	how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding ... the order told you to send me the cook &amp; serve choc.fudge pudding .... you show the picture of it .... why couldn &apos;t send it to me .... it makes me wonder if i should order anything else from you .... pissed
0	b u r n e d i read the other two reviews and didn &apos;t heed their warning. that &apos;s on me. they are &apos; usable &apos; but they were certainly burned.
0	it was time to order cat food again and i thought i &apos;d give the natural balance line a try. my cat loves fish , so i figured that the tuna and shrimp recipe would be a big hit. nope. both cats in our house gave it two thumbs down votes - neither of them would touch it. what finicky little critters they can be sometimes &#91; sigh &#93; .
0	amazon normally does a fantastic job getting product out to me in great shape and on-time , but , i guess this is one product that they can not. several jars had compromised seals and so we had to immediately throw them out. i wish i could order this by mail but it seems this is one item we &apos;ll need to go to the grocery store for.
0	started a subscription to this coffee. after receiving the first shipment i am changing my mind. it doesn &apos;t have the best flavour , and it has a terrible aftertaste to it. just not for me !
0	the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor. all the other flavor was just so-so
1	if you are a chamomile tea drinker , you will be happy to discover this tea. the citrus addition makes for a full-bodied but smooth tea. definitely the best chamomile tea on the market. also , i brew one bag in a coffee maker dedicated to tea only , and get a whole pot out of each bag. you won &apos;t be disappointed in this one.
1	product is fresh , good and i &apos;m not getting complaints anymore. that &apos;s worth the large quantity and shipping charges. hey , its oatmeal. my favorite !
0	i hated the flavor of this product , i ended up just giving it away at work who ended up giving it away to there friends.
1	yes , these are wonderful and healthy cookies , but this is a rare bad deal from amazon ( really dab nutrition ) - they are charging about $ 25 ( including shipping ) . in less than a minute of web searching i found the same quantity for about $ 15 shipped. enjoy the cookies , but buy from someone else until the price comes down.
0	i got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. well i could taste the berries but no kiwi. i did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. i think that i liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. the drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it.
1	the oriental flavor ramen noodles taste okay but i almost always add ingredients to make the dish more wholesome. i prepare it by adding sesame seed oil , vegetables and water then adding the seasoning and noodles after the water boils. rough vegetables like chopped onions taste better if they are boiled with the seasoning for 15 minutes prior to adding the noodles.
1	i found these crisps at our local walmart &amp; figured i would give them a try. they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips , not that i was a big chip fan anyway. the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting. i give these crisps a big thumbs up !
1	love the pineapple flavor. makes me feel like i am on vacation drinking a pina colada. ( you probably could add a little rum and ..... ) really tastes better than other pineapple coconut waters i have tried ! !
1	i love these hot chocolates. i think they &apos;re way better than the cafe express hot chocolates. these and the swiss miss hot chocolate are my favorite k-cups. and the price of these are the best i &apos;ve been able to find. my girlfriend and i have already gone through about half of them in about two weeks , and i never used to drink much hot chocolate. i recommend these
1	nice variety pack. has 3 dofferent hot chocolates in one package. milk , dark and peppermint. nice holiday feel. good for company during the season.
1	the walnuts and chocolate are very high quality. they are rich and decadent. it seems strange but when i &apos;m eating just a small piece it tastes like i &apos;m eating a brownie. highly recommended.
0	delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a ladies tea , not for children or most men ! appreciated only by sophisticated palates , because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. set these aside for unexpected guests you &apos;d like to impress.
1	had never heard of this brand before , however the price was right for ordering. turns out the family likes this better than the swiss miss k-cups we had been using. will continue to buy , will continue to use. don &apos;t forget to buy the mini-marshmallows at the store !
0	i bought this a few years ago and really liked it. they must have changed the recipe because this just tasted odd , sort of medicinal.
0	this product was what i like. but this shipment looks like 2eds. not good enough for the store shelves. containers were dented and some had leaked out making everything sticky.
1	i did not expect this gum to be more than just your typical &quot; lime &quot; flavored &quot; candy &quot; type taste. but i was floored. this gum literally tastes like key lime pie. i swear i can even taste a graham cracker crust. the flavor only lasts a short time , but it &apos;s an amazing taste ! floored !
0	this tasted so odd. all i can say is it tasted like aspartame. gave me an awful headache. and the chocolate was worse ! dont waste your money.
0	the switch kiwi berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good , but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. i could drink a regular can of soda. going forward , i probably would not buy this beverage because i do not like to drink that many calories ( 135 ) or sugar ( 33 grams ) in one sitting.
0	this product was certainly not worth the money. the formula is not as it was when i was a kid. even frozen this bar would not crack like it used to. igt is soft and way too sweet.
1	it has a nice strong flavor with no bitterness. how strong is it ? i would say it is similar in strength to auto-drip using 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee per 8oz of water.
1	i &apos;m trying to eat healthier and one of the things i really love is chips and salty snacks of all kinds ! these popchips really do the trick of satisfying my craving. though i don &apos;t really care for the pepper flavor , i like all of the others. i will buy these again.
1	these are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many. they have the best potato flavor. they came when you said they would.
1	i love love love these cookie bars. i can &apos;t have any sugar or any gluten and happened upon these at whole foods. what a saving grace ! the big cookies are also excellent , but i would eat the whole big cookie at one time. these little bars are perfect.
0	our dachshund loved this jug ! but once she really learned how to do it she wound up doing it so hard that the jug would slam back and hit her. she didn &apos;t apparently mind that but it broke her right canine tooth. hence , this cost us $ 2500 for a route canal ! ! !
1	just signed up for the subscribe and save option. saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store , and now it will show up every month. hopefully the rhythm will match the consumption rate of my two dogs ! ( the shortest shipping interval is 1 month , but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed )
1	the fragrance of the tea totally blew me away. recommend it to anyone who enjoys mild green tea with a pleasant rosey scent.
0	i thought these were the salted black beans but they turne out to be unsalted or at least they taste like it. i am really looking for the salted , fermented black beans
0	the tea was very weak and not that good. now i have six boxes of tea i that no one in my family likes.
1	i got it for under 7 dollars shipped ... i wouldnt pay more than eight because your not getting much cereal.
1	a coworker brought this yummyness into the office and i am so greatful. i am not big beef jerky fan but this stuff totally falls under my &quot; much yum &quot; category.
0	even though this item is listed under the gluten free category , it is not. the ingredients state that it contains wheat protein. do not order this if you need gf food. bad reviewing by amazon !
0	oh my gosh , these are gross. i bought them because of hungry girl &apos;s glowing recommendation ... and i gotta say , she steered me wrong this time. these are super salty , and they taste like what i imagine dog kibbles would taste like.
1	i really liked the premise of the product so i ordered. they are not easy to store and therefore assemble for use. but this overcomes the usefulness of the product.
0	gnats everywhere. it also comes bone dry , which means if you plant your seeds / plants without reconstituting first , you will never be able to water the pots enough for the water to soak throughout the mix. i use miracle-gro plant food , which works great , but the same cannot be said for their potting soil.
1	this candy is similar to the cry baby tears that you find in the boxes only , as the seller mentions they are coated which doesn &apos;t seem to bother me. one thing you want to keep in mind unlike the individually boxed cry baby tears these ones do not contain the grape flavor. great candy it &apos;s too bad that this is so hard to find in stores.
1	i was so glad amazon carried these batteries. i have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size. i need them for my garage door opener. great deal for the price.
0	oh boy ! oberto cocktail pep smoked sausage sticks , 32-ounce bag ( purchased on 02 / 19 / 2009 ) this was the worst product i have ever tasted. i have had many oberto products , and this was nothing like what i &apos;ve eaten before. even my dog wouldn &apos;t eat them , they were so nasty tasting.
0	good quality product , but you would have to really love curry flavor to like these ... they are so awful i don &apos;t know what to do with them , but i know i won &apos;t be eating them .... i &apos;ll stick to the plain sea salt ones : )
1	that &apos;s exactly what i was looking for to bake some chouquettes ( puffs with small sugar pearls on top ) . works great , yum ! !
1	these chips are delicious and each bag only has 100 calories. they are not fried but just baked and come in 6 different flavors. for anyone who is dieting but loves potato chips these are great.
1	my 2 gf / df girls love this instant oatmeal. we have tried many many brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best. it is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal , but not overbearing by any means ! great start to the day !
0	i bought blue diamond natural chocolate almonds before &amp; 100 % natural almonds it was good but this one made me feel sick i only eat 10 for the day &amp; i dont know if it &apos;s the salt or something else with this but i have to throw this away. i cant even move to workout im hoping i can sleep this off. but i guess im the 1 in 1 million that this happens to.
1	got these at a fraction of the price that they charge at the grocery store. this was a great buy. thanks , amazon !
1	i have been eating these since about 5 years old and are my favorite chips in the world ! just dont eat too many of them !
1	i can only say that this is great coffee , never tried before until recently .. now i like it better than folgers !
1	i found this brand and the fact that it was dark chocolate made it by far the best i &apos;ve had for my keurig. i will continue to order this particular brand.
1	i love coffee. i love coffee a lot and really don &apos;t enjoy decaf. this decaf isn &apos;t bitter though. tastes smooth and brews up very nicely. enjoyable to the last drop !
1	this is a fabulous marinade ! i love to use it for chicken , either baked in the oven or on the grill. this has enough flavor &amp; flair , i &apos;ve even used it for dinner parties , only to receive rave reviews from my guests ! ! definitely worth the price ! super cheap and super easy ! love it !
1	i won them off a penny auction site. my 2 year old likes them plenty. i don &apos;t think there is any potato flavor , they taste more like ricecakes to me , but are ok. the salt and vinegar is strong holy cow ! !
1	bought these for a birthday and they were perfect--all arrived uncracked and wrapped really well. super cute and perfect for 4 year olds.
0	i really love the oatmeal raisin cookies i ordered from pamela &apos;s , but these were really bad - they were dry , tasteless and seemed old. going back to pamela &apos;s oatmeal raisin - if i can find them.
1	love this balance blend of oils , especially in mix batters such as : pancake , cornbread , cake , etc ... , a good oil to ingest !
1	one of the best chips that you can buy ... and i &apos;ve tried all the kettle varieties , and many others. there &apos;s only a slight taste of jalapeno , and they are delicious. perfect with a sandwich or alone. if you like being addicted , these are the chip for you. ... see you at addicts anonymous ...
0	very light for the price. i buy usually at sam &apos;s and they carry nice big packs and cost something about same. don &apos;t spend your money for that , especially with &quot; special promotion &quot; = &quot; special suction &quot; .
0	went into the dumpster the very first night. my dog loves peanut butter , i thought these would be perfect , i was wrong. these are worse than the dog food they hand out at bank drive thru windows
0	i like natural products. this product tastes like feces in my opinion. i really enjoy other eden products , but this one really is an acquired taste. i am sure some folks will love it ... but in my opinion i will go for the opposite.
0	i would not recommend this oil. it does not have a pleasant smell and does not purify the skin. it &apos;s just like other oils i have bought from drug stores which were cheaper.
1	several gevalia brand coffee &apos;s have been among my favorites for years .... velvet noir , signature blend , traditional roast , etc. the breakfast blend is my &quot; go to &quot; every day grind. it &apos;s got a perfect blend of bold rich taste , terrific aroma , and full taste , with very low acidity and harshness. just incredible coffee !
1	this is a wonderful alternative to soda pop. it &apos;s delicious , refreshing and most of all , natural. i ordered the tangerine / orange. i &apos;m anxious to try the other flavors. my only gripe is that the cans are rather small. other than that , it rocks ! !
0	i made chebe rolls this evening for dinner. they needed to be cooked an extra 10 minutes and they still were gooey and sticky in the middle. they tasted somwhat okay , but the texture and color ( clear ) of the middle was very unappitizing. i won &apos;t buy them again.
0	actually typed in &quot; smoked paprika &quot; . this showed up so i ordered it and it is definatly not smoked ! also , these bottles sell for 4.95 at sam &apos;s. so , not only was it the wrong item but , i over paid also !
1	we made this purchase based on our daughter &apos;s recommendation and it is as good as she promised. we have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. we add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous !
0	when originally produced in england these we &apos;re the best chips i had ever tasted but unfortunately since they were bought out by the us conglomerate they now taste plain nasty. hard rather than crispy , are much thinner than they used to be and lacking any flavour , a real shame.
0	but the taste got sickening quite fast. it also makes a really weird stench / smell when you are microwaving it. sometimes it would hurt my tongue when i am eating it. all in all , i threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. it might just be me but i can &apos;t say i would let the guests of my home try these so i can &apos;t recommend them here to anyone.
0	this was the worst tasting tea , actually the worst tasting anything , that i have ever consumed. i took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. it tasted like dirt , which makes sense since it is a root. the rest of the tea bags are going in the trash.
1	okay , i should not eat potato chips , nor should anyone. but these are so spicy , i would find it hard to eat very many. that makes them an indulgence that rescues some people from overindulgence.
1	i can &apos;t stand gu anymore so i found these. for me , i feel like i got much more energy and so much better tasting. these taste as good as any gummi candy out there. sometimes during the week i &apos;ll open a package and eat a few every day before my workout , and i really notice the extra energy towards the end of the workout.
0	this price is not good by any stretch of the imagination ! the coffee is great but you can buy it at sam &apos;s club for about half this price. $ 11.88 for 33.9 oz.
1	we purchased these for our son to give out when his baby boy is born. they make a very nice announcement of the new arrival. they are however very hard if you actually want to chew the bubble gum.
1	the first can that i got of this wonderful oil was packed in a poor way : an old , reused box with not enough padding. when i complained the company was quick to respond - with an apology and a new can packed well for the mail. i was impressed with their responsiveness. the merula oil itself was excellent - a great treat.
0	the rope is made of rubber , and after about 30 minutes my little 20 lb. terrier had chewed up the rope , thereby eliminating the &quot; tug &quot; part of the toy. i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if she ingested some of it. for $ 10 , this toy needs a more durable rope.
1	i love this product and can &apos;t get it locally anymore. it was a fair price and the item was in stock and came quickly. i would buy from them again.
1	i &apos;m no coffee snob but this is still much better than crap you get a starbucks ( i drink black coffee so flavor really matters when its not covered by caramel and other junk ) . great coffee for a great price , especially if you get it when amazon is offering the $ 3 off coupon.
1	smooth with no sacrifice in taste and does taste as good as regular coffee. i usually don &apos;t have any coffee after dinner and never really cared for decaf but i now have an after dinner alternative and no sacrifice in flavor.
0	i came across this searching for paleo-friendly products on amazon. &quot; canola &quot; oil is not paleo. admittedly , the product does not specifically advertise as paleo , but really , canola oil is very unhealthy. skip this and ask for wilderness family to re-stock their mayo.
1	we absolutely love the sugar free cherry kool-aid but have a very hard time finding it in stores. when we discovered it on line we bought a bunch. it is a wonderful product ! hope they keep making it ! delicious !
1	for whatever reason , our son really likes this flavor. i &apos;m not a fan myself , but i &apos;m not the one eating it. any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting , i &apos;m a happy mom.
1	packed poorly in shipping and a few had the seal broken because they were rolling around in the box !
0	8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what i &apos;d say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. i &apos;m not a sugar lover. all in all not big enough to quench my thirst , and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.natural but not that intensely citrus.
0	if i could give this food a zero i would. i tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. it was horrible , smelled bad , and i would never get it again !
0	very flimsy material. not true to size , extremely small. color is not as described. light moss looks more like dark brown / green ! don &apos;t waste your money on these tee shirts.
1	my dog really enjoys these treats and the plus is that they help keep his teeth clean too. will definatly purchase these again.
1	for those of you who like / love black licorice , i seriously recommend this product. i eat it because i love black licorice , and only recently found that what i have observed is now reported by nuitionists as well. these is evidence that black licorice is an aid to those with constipation. it comes in other flavors too , but the medicinal effects only come the black.
1	good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape &amp; ntilde ; o or paramsan garlic. packaging is difficult to open , but they fresh.
1	they aren &apos;t fattening and they &apos;re good for you , right ? that &apos;s what i heard , at least , from an admittedly unreliable person.
0	i purchased 2 other types of blue diamond almonds on the same day , and they were both around $ 11 for a pack of 3. t his one was only one 8 oz. container , and i assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $ 8.
1	i really like this hot chocolate mix. i was concerned , when i read some of the reviews , that i would not like it but i like it alot. to me it has just the right amount of chocolate and is not to sweet. i would recommend this product.
1	if you have been out to philmont on a treck or as staff these are given to you in your trail meal. they are organic and made of honey. they good and healthy. a +
1	i got the o.n.e. coconut water w / splash of pineapple &amp; it &apos;s delicious &amp; not the least bit sweet. just very refreshing ! ! love it and will continue using it. saw this on dr. oz as he recommended it.
0	i purchased this for my baby , but as soon as i opened it smelled pretty bad. i tried to give it to my baby and she hated it , she threw up. i don &apos;t recommend this product. gerber rice cereal is much better.
0	for something that is close to 60 bucks this was very dissapointing. the basket i received looked nothing like whats in the picture. i got a small foil pack of maybe 10 crackers no chocolate candies and a small box of candies that i can get at walmart for 2 bucks. they even changed the contents of the items without notifying me. this will be a never again buy.
1	i used to go to a local coffee shop to get these drinks for about $ 4. now i can make them at home for a fraction of the cost. they are delicious ! i like the single serving packets , but my husband and i end up using three packets to make two good size drinks.
1	these dates were absolutely delicious. i was a little bit worried because the one product review that it had was only one star. but as i looked at all the other date reviews , the trend seemed to be bad reviews in the fall timeframe. i had these delivered mid-january and must say they were quite exquisite. many thanks for a great treat at a large dinner party.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0012bzghs &quot; &gt; stash premium mint green iced tea powder , 12-count packets ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt; light mint taste , easy to mix powdered tea , great on ice.
1	received very quickly and extremely well packaged. since this is a smaller sized basket , it would be an adorable present for anyone who likes tea , for self or just to have to hand. very nicely assembled with attention to detail.
1	i finally finished my box of the blueberry green tea powder and wanted to try something new ! so glad i tried this flavor as it is now my favorite ! just add it to a cold bottle of water , drink it as is , or add a few drops of stevia or agave and you are good to go. very refreshing ! ! will be packing this on my trip to mexico !
1	love bob &apos;s redmill the best of the best. pay a little more than the other guys but all american and employee owned ! ! ! pumpking seeds are high on the calorie chart so just a teaspoon at a time ! !
1	great meal replacement drink that tastes great ! you get plenty of protein and other vital nutrients. i prepare one of these whenever i &apos;m on the go and i won &apos;t have to worry about missing a meal. the best bang for your buck , especially if you subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program.
1	i have 4 adult shih-tzus and while they do prefer it when i cook for them ...... they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when i feed them some dry foods.
1	my item got to my house on time and i was surprised on how well my package was packed. i recommend this store to anyone ; )
0	i am definitely not a coffee connoisseur , but this stuff is bad. it is a disappointment because i expected a wolfgang puck product to have more &quot; class. &quot; this tastes artificial and it can &apos;t stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener. will not buy again !
1	product received is as advertised. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001gvisjm &quot; &gt; twizzlers , strawberry , 16-ounce bags ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	i didn &apos;t like the taste of this product - couldn &apos;t finish it off because it was a little metallic tasting and had an aftertaste.
1	arrowhead mills organic savory herb stuffing has a very nice blend of herbs for a flavor that compliments chicken and turkey. i especially appreciate the fact that there are no transfats used in this stuffing so i and my family can enjoy it without worry ! the stuffing is very easy to prepare , but really adds to the meal. we use it all year long. why wait for a holiday to enjoy good food ?
1	these energy chews have a great flavor , will give you good energy before or during a workout , and are a reasonable price. i would recommend this to any endurance athlete such as a cyclist , runner , triathlete , etc. strength training and sports nutrition for cycling
1	you just can &apos;t beat the taste of the original dubble bubble gumballs ! it really doesn &apos;t matter that the taste only last a minute or so , but that is why i bought the tub ! the tub by the way is very convenient and was shipped to me in a + + + condition ! if your longing for the classic taste go for it ! you will not be dissappointed !
1	this review is mostly about the seller. they are great ! the product arrived within 2 days , with standard shipping. i have never had black truffles before. they have a very earthy , smoky flavor that really emerges when lightly sauteed in butter. they are an expensive , pleasant , treat.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000odry9i &quot; &gt; wish bone fat free ranch salad dressing , 16-ounce bottle ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt; this is a great salad dressing ... tastes just as good and is as flavorful as the regular &apos; fatfull &apos; dressing.
0	original description and order said &quot; assorted &quot; chocolates. what i got--weeks ( ! ) later--was one pack of all white chocolates ( the least desirable ) . not worth the bother of returning even with prime. might be better just buying at local store ( same or cheaper price ) when you can see what you get.
0	this is my least favorite of these bars. the white coating is dry and way too sweet. stick with the peanut butter and chocolate varieties.
0	probably because it doesn &apos;t taste like coffee. it is flavorless. i saw the good reviews and thought i &apos;d get a couple boxes and now i &apos;m stuck with a bunch of k cups that i don &apos;t want to drink because i &apos;d rather literally drink any other k cup i &apos;ve ever tried. as you can see i &apos;m not a fan of these k cups. these are the worst ever.
1	i am so glad i ordered this ; it is the best dulce de leche i have been able to find. i had read about this somewhere and am now convinced that many people are not familiar with this product. if you like anything caramel , you &apos;ll love this !
0	i was excited to have some seasonal items out of season , but i didn &apos;t know they would be three seasons old. they were so hard that i couldn &apos;t eat a single one and i had to throw them all away.
0	both my boyfriend and i found that this coffee was way to weak and tasteless. i am back to looking for a coffee i can enjoy
1	my small mixed breed is a picky eater but he seems to like solos so long as i mix it with some good people food. he hasnt had problems digesting it delivery was prompt as expected.
1	i love this tea. it helps curb my eating during the day. my mom and i have given it all friends to try.
1	i got this for a gift for my father and he loved them. i will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
1	you can exchange this baking mix for regular flour in almost any recipe. also makes yummy pancakes and waffles !
0	i spent $ 26.00 dollares for a tiny box of cookies and some 2 pc samples. this is the biggest rip off.
1	tried this sauce first at our favorite place to eat out. was very happy to be able to order some for our home cooking ! great ! spicy hot and sweet !
1	this will ruin supermarket mustard for you. high quality and just the right amount of bite so it allows the food to shine through.
1	i enjoy this cocoa very much , the children love it and drink it often. i would purchase this product again.
1	the only difference i can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you don &apos;t get the usual &quot; sugar rush &quot; when you eat the result. cookies and pies made with this splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before. great stuff ! and it &apos;s gluten-free too.
0	i never got the product and complained about the non receipt. so i bought some in the store. klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf
1	love these ! i &apos;m not a fan of potato chips but these taste fresh and not at all greasy. a little like pringles but much tastier.
0	so far i &apos;m not impressed with this popcorn. it &apos;s tender when popped , but it &apos;s really annoying how much doesn &apos;t pop. i &apos;m going to add a little water and then let it sit , closed up , for a while and see if that helps. as of right now , i wouldn &apos;t buy this popcorn again.
1	i really love these snacks. they are low in calories and fat while being high in protein , which is important to me because i am a vegetarian.
0	the taste is less then desired. i ordered three canisters all together and can &apos;t return them. my suggestion to anyone that wants to try it is to order just one and see how they like.
0	tart , bitter aftertaste , horrible diet rootbeer ! it makes me feel bad drinking this and i probably won &apos;t ever buy this brand name again.
0	i have always made my own pancake and waffle mix ; no pre-made stuff for me ! ! i tried this mix and not one person really liked it. it is a heavy , cornmeal floury taste. back to my own recipe.
1	i really like the flavors and the fact that the chips are low in fat. i especially like the bbq and salt and vinegar. i don &apos;t care for the salt and pepper. i wish i could get a multipack and choose the flavors i want.
0	i just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received. i ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed. all flavors have a really weird taste to them , except for maybe the plain chips. the salt and vinegar especially tasted gross ! i took one bite and had to throw the bag away. now i &apos;m stuck with a bunch of chips that i &apos;ll never eat.
1	this is the good stuff ! i am eating some right now with some sweet basil tomato sauce. this pasta has a neat shape and it cooks up nicely. it &apos;s colorful and tasty and is great &quot; al dente &quot; .
0	i thought i needed to clean my machine ... however , it was this coffee. when i placed another companies coffee in , it tasted fine. i have 2 boxes if anyone wants them.
0	almost no detectable coffee flavor below the raspberry aroma. probably would go well for those that like flavored creamers. mostly this is warm water that smells like raspberries. very little detectable chocolate. i bought this as an alternative for my kids. it might work for them when the hot chocolate runs out.
1	chamomile tea is great with lemons and apriva. chamomile tea is caffeine free that &apos;s great for pregnant women and those with high blood pressure.
1	it got here fast , grew quickly and my cats love it. excellent choice anyone can make their cats very happy by purchasing this product , plus my cats have completely stopped chewing on all other plants in the house.
1	reveived my item fast ! it was exactly what i ordered in excellent shape with safe shipping - i will came back and shop here again. thanks
0	while the product is delicious , it &apos;s annoying that the peanut butter stays on the waxy paper instead of on the product. you need a fork to scrape the peanut butter off the protective top sheet.
1	this is a very delicious gravey mix. i add a pound or so of browned , drained breakfast sausage after it is heated and serve over bisquits. it is super fast and easy. i serve with cut up fresh fruit and there you have a simple , quick breakfast or brunch meal ! i would highly recommend.
0	digestives are up to standard , but the poor packing from amazon left half of them crumbled before they were even out of the box
0	love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. i gave this to my mother who loves sweets and she said she couldn &apos;t eat it either. need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar
0	spent $ 29 for real kona coffee and didn &apos;t want the kona blend sold here. the hawaiian roasters was disappointing. tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in maui. not good
1	this is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. the kids love it quick and easy.i will order this hot chocolate again.
1	i have tried several types of hot chocolate since purchasing my keurig and this is by far the one i enjoy the most. i have it shipped every month so that i don &apos;t worry about running out ! ! !
1	my little girl will ask for these crackers day and night. bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick. i will be back for more very soon.
0	i wanted to get some jerky and since i like buffalo wings i tried these. the problem is there is way too much salt , it &apos;s disgustingly salty , way more than normal jerky. i can barely eat it. if you eat a 3.25 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium , instant high blood pressure.
0	i ordered this item as i got to see it as recommended by dr.sears .. but the pack of 6 with this flavor doesn &apos;t work for my baby ... my baby didn &apos;t like the taste .. i don &apos;t know why : ( .. had it been packed with different flavors .. i would have atleast tried the other flavor ... as this item is not eligible for returns .. i am just wondering what to do with this ...
1	i love these disposakups. they allow me to use some of my favorite canned or fresh bean coffee in my keurig coffee maker. there is no mess , easy as using the regular k kups , just throw away when you are done making your coffee. love the convenience. i have just place a 2nd order.
1	product has similar taste of wheat pancakes without the gluten. even other family members not on gluten-free diet like it.
0	i hated this coffee. i &apos;m much more of a starbucks or peet &apos;s loyalist , so maybe i &apos;m a bit spoiled. but after reading many positive reviews of this company i decided to give it a try. big mistake. i had a hard time giving it away. it definitely tastes like chicory. blagk. bad news.
1	a bit dry but still good. they may be perfectly all right ; i just thought the noodles were hard and dry. i &apos;m still enjoying them.
1	this coffee was really good. been trying to find it in new york , but haven &apos;t been able to. i think it &apos;s worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered. i &apos;ve ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic. also , i think the caffeine content is pretty high , as i &apos;m more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands.
0	i have purchased locally many other flavors of da vinci syrups , and ordered blueberry online to try it , because it isnt available locally- and i love blueberry ! well , this was a disappointment to me- very very sugary sweet with little blueberry flavor ; not to mention i paid 4x what i would pay locally. # very disappointed
1	my dogs go crazy over liver biscottis. they are nice and crunchy which helps clean their teeth and all the ingredients are wholesome.
0	this was a very disappointing coffee. it is very weak , i had to set my brew to a medium just to get any flavor from it and large is very watered down. i would find something different before buying this again.
0	i thought this was a jamaican blend or roast , but turns out it &apos;s simply a heavily flavored coffee. the flavor tastes artificial - like fake maple syrup flavoring. we have three coffee drinkers in our house and none of us could get past the first few sips. now i have to find a home for the rest of it so it doesn &apos;t go to waste.
0	holy cow ! i have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this ! also , it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs ! use it in your garden , don &apos;t eat it !
0	unpleasant taste. i wouldn &apos;t say &quot; bitter &quot; but just &quot; off &quot; for me. it had an intense-strong taste but lacked depth if that makes any sense. wish i could be a fan , but it wouldn &apos;t be a choice i would make in the future. on the positive - their label is cute !
0	on an empty stomach , in a controlled environment , with plenty of water , i felt no physical change to stress levels , at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from xanax. like homeopathic medicince ( highly diluted ) , this product is bunk. but it tastes good , and maybe it could have a little placebo effect.
1	i use this coffee in my espresso maker and all i have to say it wow ! the espresso is smooth , with a hint of chocolate and slightly bitter finish. it &apos;s the perfect coffee bean for espresso for me. i hate that strong bitter finish you get with some espresso beans ( like starbucks ) and you don &apos;t get that with this coffee. i love it and will be ordering more !
1	we absolutely loved the chips and after ordering them from amazon we were able to find them in target. they have a really good flavor and we would eat them even if we weren &apos;t trying to loose weight. recommended by weight watchers.
1	as far as single serve cocoas go , this is one of the best. i wouldn &apos;t say it &apos;s as good as some of the handmade ones , but it &apos;s still good !
1	i like to put wild rice in many dishes. this is a good buy and easy to drop into other rice dishes or soups.
1	the product arrived quickly. all bags and chips were in place ... and safe ; -d these chips are delicious and only four ww points !
1	this product was a gift to a far distant relative. it arrived right on schedule , in perfect condition and she loved the choices inside the basket. i cannot attest to the food personally , but she loved it !
1	i like the bisquick , it works great in a variety of uses. wish it came in a bigger box , the recipes are good on the box though.
0	these crackers taste absolutely delicious , but leave a coating / aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time. also , they contain msg and for some people ( i &apos;m one of them ) it causes a headache. the last time i binged on these crackers ( and they are hard to put down ! ) , i ended up with a crashing headache. be forewarned !
1	i have tried a few of the cocoa cups and find this product about average. unless you stir the cup the cocoa will taste watery for a few sips.
0	i had so hoped they would be close or better than cheetos flamin &apos; hot but they aren &apos;t. they were not past the expiration by 3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. i gave the rest of the case to the food shelter.
1	my baby loves this apple sauce. he didn &apos;t like the gerber brand at all , but yummys this down right away and i like that it is organic.
1	i have bought this product before. these snacks are crisp and great tasting. also low in calories. i recommend them highly. they are shipped almost instantly and arrive within a few days.
1	great snack and good on salads. it &apos;s dried peas , what else can i say ?
0	i expected better. flavor is o.k. but half of the rinds do not puff up no matter what the timing in the microwave.
0	my favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like french , italian , and full city. this k-cup dark roast has a big , bold flavor , but lacks balance. the level of smokiness , bitterness , and acid are way too high , and the result is not enjoyable. i liked the dark roasts. for the keurig from green mt , newman , and donut shop much more than this one.
1	my mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven. they didn &apos;t believe they deserved receiving these , but i know they did deserve to receive these !
1	after finding out two of our family members have celiac disease , we had to give up licorice and cherry nibs. candy tree &apos;s organic cherry bites have no sugar and truly rival the cherry nibs with gluten. after a year of not having the &quot; real thing &quot; my husband believes candy tree &apos;s are actually better.
0	i ordered the teenie pack of greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. i ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. i returned the product because i did not receive what i ordered. amazon couldn &apos;t replace my order because they couldn &apos;t guarantee i would get the right product if ordered again.
1	how good these cookies really are. they &apos;re delicious , satisfying , and really , really healthy. definitely a great alternative to &quot; real &quot; cookies.
1	i have lived out of the us for over 7 yrs now , and i so miss my twizzlers ! ! when i go back to visit or someone visits me , i always stock up. all i can say is yum ! sell these in mexico and you will have a faithful buyer , more often than i &apos;m able to buy them right now.
1	my wife just loves these cups. first off i have to say they arrived a month earlier than stated. excellent ! the convenience of being able to use your own coffee and throw away the little cups afterwards is fantastic. no clean-up. excellent.
1	like the flavor and it &apos;s thick , unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny.
1	this is the best clam chowder ever. come originally where this is produced and was so happy when i found it on line. keep this in my cupboard at all time. being an old maine girl this is my favorite chowder of all times.
1	i bought these chocolate liquor cups for a party ! it was a big hit. they are high quality and a good buy.
1	great product ! love making this during the fall and winter months because the smell goes through the entire house reminding me of christmas. taste great too especially when warm and with cream cheese. have made it for co-workers who always rave about it. it &apos;s easy to make up , too.
1	mine came with stickers to sell them for $ 1.59 but they cost more like $ 1.25 so if for retail that is not much of a mark up. i bought these for myself so that doesn &apos;t really matter and they are cheap. similar to lay &apos;s but cheaper. unlike other knockoffs these seemed to taste fresher and the convenient size minimizes stale chips. great product. great price.
1	works fine for my podcasting needs. i use it with a sure sm58 microphone. it is made of plastic and does feel cheap but i have had it for a few months and had zero problems with it. for desktop use it should be fine. works great for my needs. wouldn &apos;t recommend for heavy use on a stage or being tossed around.
0	i got sent the wrong item , which happens i know. i tried to contact the company multiple times with no response. i finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me ...
0	found my kids actually cutting open the pods and dumping them into a cup to add hot water too. they complained that lots of the good stuff stays in the pod. kind of defeats the purpose of the packaging , so we switched back to packets.
1	i &apos;ve used natures logic dog food for about a year. the difference in my dogs is impressive. their coats are like silk. what a wonderful product !
1	i &apos;ve always bought yellow popcorn , but after reading the reviews for snappy white i decided to give it a try. it &apos;s tender and delicious ! i &apos;ll be ordering more , it &apos;s now my favorite popcorn.
1	no harsh after taste , no tangible negatives. it just doesn &apos;t have the &quot; bite &quot; that i crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer. it &apos;s a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz.
0	my 3 month old jack russell terrier totally love it ... but it last for an hour or so. look on the customer pictures to see what i mean.
0	my son used to love the chick chick , gobble gobble , and super salmon. but they changed the recipe , and now it &apos;s more corn than anything else. taste is bad too. nutrition value is lower. he doesn &apos;t like it , and neither do i. i am totally pissed.
1	this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted ... it &apos;s clean , bright , fresh ... great delivery ... again quality ... just try it ...
0	i felt energized within five minutes , but it lasted for about 45 minutes. i paid $ 3.99 for this drink. i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money.
0	i thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. you have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. i &apos;ve only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. the figs just lay on top unspreadable. i would not buy again. save your money.
0	i believe that this product is old / expired or being stored incorrectly. only about half the kernels popped and the kernels that did pop had an odd chewy / stale texture to them. i would not recommend buying from this company.
1	i love this organic raw honey ! when using it in my tea i don &apos;t need a lot and the taste is great. honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it i also use it on my hair and face often. the darker the better.
1	great oysters , fast shipping. can &apos;t find them local so i took a chance and they were great ! they were frozen when i got them and package was well packed.
0	i was very disappointed that this coffee did not have much coconut taste at all and now i &apos;m stuck with 4 bags ! i tastes ok as plain coffee but that &apos;s not what i wanted. i think if you gave a cup to someone and didn &apos;t tell them it was flavored they would think it was plain coffee.
1	these are one of my favorite ways to eat grains plus they are a good source of protein. 17 chips per serving is just about right. i wish they had a little less salt but for the calorie / fat / fiber content , they are pretty healthy. great with soup or salads or just plain. i would definitely recommend these.
0	carabou mahogony is the worst tasting cup of coffee i have ever had , and i &apos;ve been drinking coffee for over 4 decades. it tastes just like a piece of burnt toast. the only way i can make it palatable is to put it over ice , add lots of vanilla sugar syrup and milk. i &apos;ve got to find some way to justify the purchase and icing it seems to help.
1	recieved the truffles in one day shipping the customer service is over the top ... i opened the jar and enjoyed the aroma , i will shop with them again
1	great taffy at a great price. there was a wide assortment of yummy taffy. delivery was very quick. if your a taffy lover , this is a deal.
1	this olive oil is great. tastes very good and is outstanding for use with bread , pasta , and for cooking in general. love the flavor.
1	if there is one thing our dog likes , it is the liver biscotti dog treats. these make the best rewards and training treats we have used.
1	we use our keurig every day. when a friend gave us a sample we went crazy , it is the best hot chocolate ever. i highly recommend this , it is a treat in the evening to take the place of dessert.
1	i prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts , particularly in uncooked items and beverages. it has a fairly thick / syrupy consistency.
1	i love this kool-aid mix and they stopped selling it at my local albertsons ( boooooooooooo ) luckily i found it here and it is even cheaper than it was in store ! !
0	i suppose some people might rate this product higher as it is a great substitute for bisquik , however i didn &apos;t like it because everything i made from it tasted like bisquik.
1	it &apos;s always wonderful to be able to give chocolates as a gift and to receive them. it &apos;s great to know that you can send someone some chocolates with the guarantee that they don &apos;t arrive all melted. good service and excellent chocolates !
1	this oil is wonderful. i &apos;ve had almond oil that was so strong it overwhelmed what i was using it for ( salad , cooking ) . i loved the flavor of this oil and will be buying more.
1	the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores. i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $ 1. dissapointing !
1	got this free with another order i placed. i couldn &apos;t believe how much the cats loved it. i will buy again for sure.
0	the product stinks and that &apos;s mildly stated. the caps do not snap on easily and if you apply too much pressure the cup part caves in and you end up with ground coffee everywhere. i threw the whole order into the trash and called it a day. i will be using professionally produced k-cups ( i.e , dunkin donuts , starbucks , even folgers ) from this point on.
0	this product gave me a horrible rash. it contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens. they need to list allergens.
0	i had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. next time i try popping it ( i do have 23 more packs to go through ) i &apos;ll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. i don &apos;t know how this popcorn got such ratings. i &apos;ll give it another shot though out of the love i have for popcorn.
1	these are delicious. they have the same consistency as a spree or runt , and they are sour all the way through. i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll be ordering some more.
0	as coffee in general , this wolfgang variety was alright. however , i was expecting a &quot; creme caramel &quot; taste , or something similar , and i don &apos;t feel this delivered. i tried multiple cups at different cup sizes and this coffee just didn &apos;t do it for me. it is marketed as a flavored coffee , yet i could not taste anything beyond the flavor of coffee.
1	i like the ease of this mix. i haven &apos;t tried anything but pancakes. they were great ! i did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein , which made them less fluffy but not less tasty. i can &apos;t wait to try this mix for chicken. i really miss fried chicken.
1	i don &apos;t understand why this dog food is not full of reviews. checkout &#91; &amp; # 8230 ; &#93; they give this dog food 4 out of 5 stars which beats science diet and purina one which i use to use and diamond natural is less expensive.
0	if this is supposed to be a top notch dog food , my dogs sure don &apos;t think so. there is a very odd smell to this food , it almost smells as if it is bad. same smell came from the bison flavor as well. my dogs won &apos;t eat it. obviously other dogs like it otherwise they &apos;d be out of business. sorry i wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff.
0	i was excited to receive my movie theatre style popcorn. i was extremely dissatisfied when i received my item because it was old ! the oil was completely dried out &amp; the popcorn barely popped and tasted very stale. i feel like i wasted $ 17.00 !
1	so this bag of skittles is really worth it. comes with a load of skittles filled too the top of the bag. skittles is my favorite candy now i order the 3.5lb all the time. its enough to share and still have a lot left over
1	these are a great grab and go snack that satisfy. i love pop corn but don &apos;t eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while i am eating it at the movies , so i take grandpa po &apos;s originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag ! i know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way i enjoy to eat them. i love these ! ! !
1	this food is great - all ages dogs. i have a 3 year old and a puppy. they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick. the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping : )
1	i love these chips and ordered them after i had some in florida. my case of chips came without any packing inside. all bags in a box with no cushioning at all. needless to say most of the chips were broken and i would not order them again. a great item but if they can &apos;t package to aid in minimal chip breakage then one is wasting their money.
0	i did get a good laugh out of my one bone that i had ordered thinking i was getting a cute basket of bones for the 130.49 value .so do not let the picture deceive you as it did me.so this item is so not worth it . &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000ihxml4 &quot; &gt; merrick smoked beefy jerky bone 2-3 &quot; &lt; / a &gt;
0	i love mashed potatoes. but i goofed on this batch. these are much too highly seasoned for my taste. betty crocker tried too hard to be distinctive. if she had let the poor reds be themselves they would have been wonderful.
1	this tea is very good. i discovered it while visiting in california. the moment i got home i searched local stores for it and i was not able to find it. finally i decided to see if amazon had it and they did and i bought two boxes. as long as they make it i will buy it.
1	delicious candy. outstanding price for such a rich product. the &quot; fortunes &quot; on the inside are an added bonus. great options relating to packaging.
1	great tasting product and is much better than other cocoas i have tasted in this type of single serve. job well dont grove square !
1	these are the best alternative chips i have ever tried. i have shared them with friends and relatives and they all agree. you get enough in the single serve packs to be truly satisfied and if you are a weight watchers customer , they are great , only 2 points for each bag ! ! !
1	i drive otr ... over the road truck and this helps to keep me alert. it has no sugar high &amp; no crash. i &apos;m on a autoship which i like. the price is very good. i &apos;ve seen it over 2 bucks in the store.
0	this is pretty retarded - how many have you sold , at double the cool , refreshing retail price ? you &apos;re a freak.
0	i liked these tubs for a few months and then realized that they contain fish oil and gelatin. why put these products in a vegetarion seeming food ? beware ! i &apos;m going to review all of gerber &apos;s products carefully now. totally dissapointed with gerber.
1	i have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review , but they like all the flavors , the textures are great , and the jars open easily. great on the go snack.
1	the popchips were great and they were fresh when they arrived. for the price , i wish there were more bags of chips for my bucks.
1	when i was talking to a neighbor about getting a keurig she told me not to get cocoa. this was in a group of beverages that i got when i ordered my keurig and i think it is very good. it is rich , creamy , and exactly what i want when i want a cup of cocoa ! i would order this again.
1	love this product ! it adds flavor to your water without all the nasty artificial sweetners. hope this product is here to stay !
0	i was in a hurry and did not read the reviews ... i trusted amazon &apos;s description and it did not indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was not jamaican ... it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. i feel cheated.
0	these are a cheap fake. nothing like the real emerald nuts you buy in the store. its a complete waste of money. dont get ripped off like i did.
1	i ordeed this product because this tea is really good. the shipment came as expected. i love the taste of this tea. it &apos;s not stong at all.
1	pretty good product. the taste isn &apos;t the best but it &apos;s definitely not the worse either. it gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.
0	i believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. it now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
1	happy with this purchase , it &apos;s a good deal. it &apos;s the most fragrant coriander ever ! coriander is a super spice , tri-dosha ( and a health supplement as well , research it , it &apos;s a ground cilantro seed ) . we use it in lots of dishes. thank you !
0	the worst ! ! ! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the hazel nut flavor at all ! ! ! ! ! do not buy this product save your money ! ! ! ! !
0	great idea , but my fido is so frustrated he lays there and crying and barking hoping the treats will fall out. still working on training him , but not sure this is good for his psyche. he &apos;d much rather unscrew the bottom if he could.
1	i read other reviews before buying and they are not encoraging .. but still for some reasons , i got to buy ( to use my amazon gift card ) . but then i am very happy with the purchase. delivery is prompt. quantity is correct . over all a few bucks savings than you buy at a retail shop.
0	a terrible product we follow the intructions and did not get the the pork rinds. we only got pieces of pork skin
1	i have ordered these raisins multiple times. they are always great and arrive timely. i can &apos;t go back to store bought chocolate covered raisins now ! love this product.
1	i am a chip fanatic , when i heard of these , i had to give them a try ! they are very tasteful esp. the bbq one &apos;s. i have yet to try the other flavors but i am sure they will not disappoint. i watch my weight / health so these are perfect , just becareful because they are addicting !
1	i &apos;ve tried 5-hour energy , red rain , nos , and other energy shots. this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect. plus , it &apos;s somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used. sometimes i wonder what i &apos;m really putting into my body with some of the other brands. i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years.
0	something is not right. tastes very old. stale. weak. weak at 8 ounces. weak at 6 ounces. strength ok at 4 ounces but tastes horrible. not only will i not buy this coffee again , i won &apos;t buy green mountain coffee again. very bad.
0	there may be people who like blue cornmeal. i had never had any , don &apos;t know if it was supposed to taste like it did or not , but it was awful. don &apos;t sell any more of this , amazon.
0	i was sorely disappointed in these cookies .. they are pretty tasteless and damn hard too .. i wouldn &apos;t buy them again and i &apos;ve certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies .. i definitely recommend saving your money , folks ..
0	this is mostly concentrated apple and grape juice reconstituted with carbonated water ; it &apos;s extremely sweet and more caloric than soda. do people who consume this think they &apos;re drinking something healthy , or indulging in liquid candy ? or is this supposed to be used as a mixer , e.g. , for making daiquiris ?
1	this taste just like brown sugar with less sugar. i use this for everything , that requires sugar ( baking , est .. ) i use less of this than is required , like if it says use 1 / 2 cup i use 1 / 3 of splenda brown sugar.
1	there where plenty of times we had to eat out ... but ... then came mae ploy sweet chili sauce ... now we can eat in whih the same flavor , exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants ! ! !
1	sent very prompty , tea is delicious , will continue to use this company with great enthusiasm.
1	milder than most vinegars , but with its own very special taste to add to ume plum vinegar , and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor !
1	excellent , lo-fat , lo- calorie treat for dogs. i have a german shorthair pointer-and these treats are her favorite ( the organic peanut butter cookies are for smaller dogs , but she loves them-and for weight-control i like them ! )
0	merchandise was not damaged during shipment but supplier send me damaged and incorrect merchandise. 3 / 4 of the cans were badly dented and the cans they shipped were not dop certified. they sent me lower standard merchandise. received full refund from amazzon.
0	i should have looked closer at the description. i am quite disappointed that a product that is called &quot; eating right &quot; would contain hfcs ( high fructose corn syrup ) . the taste isn &apos;t all that great either.
0	needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. when the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that i could dump back into the litter box.
1	almost identical to ghiradeli &apos;s great chocolate taste ... but raw ! organic ! the best ! ! ! i also whip it into whipped up sprouted almonds with strvia and make ball / snacks from it , yummmm
1	i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on. because it &apos;s bite size it &apos;s easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick. my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping.
1	my giant schnauzer was weaned on this food. when we changed to blue buffalo , eukanauba lamb and rice , and nutro he developers allergies. this is the only food that works.
0	... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is insane ! the sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping , it was not worth it.
0	first time ordering this jerky from amazon , and i highly recommend to everyone do not buy it ! it is harder than a rock. i have bought it from other sellers not amazon , and it is much better. the experation date is not for another year , but you cannot even bite it or chew it. horrible , i think its the worst jerky ive ever bought !
0	okay this review would be about how it tasted but it never arrived at my door ... i ordered it and they didnt even send it eww.this site sucks balls.they didnt even refund my money when i talked to them.ewwthis site sucks and i hope it gets shut down.very very soon ! ! ! ! eww ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ps i rate them negative 1000
1	we have played this with three adults. fun game that does not take too long to play. makes you think and plan only to have someone else mess up your plans.
0	i use to purchase jamaica beans locally and it was great. this jamaica me crazy is nothing close to it. the odor is terrible and it tastes like the coffee is flat or stale. other people in household tried it and couldn &apos;t get past the first cup. pitched the remainder cups in the trash.
0	the ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason. they are brown , mushy , and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist. on top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar. no living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul.
1	i tried the black cherry version and liked it but this one is much better. great orange taste plus the benefit of juice. and no corn syrup sweetner for those worried about its use. the carbonation helps make it a satisfying drink to quench thirst and the knowledge that it is healthy satisfies the mind as well.
0	i made one for my daughter &apos;s birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. still tasted pretty good , though.
1	received as shown. my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them. it was great i could get them on amazon.
1	i enjoy the flavor and use it for much of my cooking and add it as the oil to my home made granola. it does not cook well on high heats ( as advertised ) , but does well at medium to low heat. it &apos;s health benefits far outweigh vegetable oil and canola oils. i use both this and coconut oils whenever possible for flavor.
1	i am giving this as a gift to go along with a single coffee brewer. though ratings say there are problems , saving money on easy to purchase coffee is better. we live in the sticks in wisconsin.
1	so , these seeds do exactly as advertised. i bought 10 paks of seeds , and have so far used 4. i always get a pot full of strong , bright green grass , which my cat readily devours. not much else can be said. good deal , good grass. man.
0	i don &apos;t taste cheese - i taste an unidentifiable chemical and a lot of salt ! normally i love salty snacks , and especially cheesy ones , but the salt is overwhelming. yuck ! do not believe the &quot; better than cheetos &quot; hype. my favorite snack is cheetos , and i &apos;m definitely going back.
1	we tried all flavors for our cats and the rabbit was the apparent favorite for all of them. took a recommendation from catinfo.org for this food as it is closest to the diet that a cat would naturally eat. coats are softer and glossy. energy levels seem to be up. quite pleased with the results so far.
1	the toasted flavor is so much better than regular walnut oil ; the price is the best i can find and we store it in the fridge for longer life.
0	i personally did not care for the coffee , too mild for me and a little &quot; nutty &quot; flavor in it. i will stick with tully &apos;s kona and house blends , also emeril &apos;s big easy bold.
1	i love this sauce ! it is sweet and molasses-y , with a tiny kick of heat. i use it to make hawaiian chicken or pork all the time. i &apos;ve never had authentic jamaican jerk , so i can &apos;t vouch for accuracy there , but my whole family loves this one : d
1	we have the k-cup , however , these disposable k-cups are the best ever. i am always rushed in the morning and cleaning out the old k-cup to make another cup of coffee to put in the togo cup , is not what i want to do ... i &apos;m so grateful to have found this product ! ! !
0	aweful ! they arrived immediately and still were as hard as cement ! the bags &apos; supposed re-sealable zipper , didn &apos;t re-seal once and maybe the large amount had something to do with it but again , i cannot believe how stale and terrible the candy inside was !
1	who knew juice could be so cool ? it has a very refreshing taste and lightness , just the right amount of sweet ( not too much ) . switch is an apt name for this beverage. i am guessing that lots of folks will be making the &quot; switch &quot; from cola to &quot; carbonated juice &quot; once they get a taste of this product line.
1	of all the flavors vita coco produces , the pineapple combination is by far the best - it has just enough flavor to keep it interesting but not overpowering.
1	this is definitely too strong if you make one glass from one k-cup. i &apos;ve experimented. now i run two k-cups through the large cup brew three times each. i add each cup to a pitcher. then i add enough water to fill my three-quart pitcher. i sweeten it with stevia , and add juice from one lime. great iced tea !
0	i would never buy this cake. it looks horrible. some of the fondant work on this seller &apos;s other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible ... worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. the flowers look like red and green blobs. how can you possibly think you should sell these to people ?
0	i was highly disappointed in the popcorn. i have the whirlypop maker and couldn &apos;t wait to get this popcorn to have the theatre popcorn taste. the first time the popping liquid was runny and the second time it was solid. each time it didn &apos;t work as the directions said it would and when it does finally start to pop it burns .......... highly disappointed - sorry i bought 3-5 packs
0	no where in the description does it mention that this is a flavored coffee. by the name i thought it was a jamaican blue mountain blend but its flavored with a weak tasting hazelnut. not very good
0	tastes like cat food and has a similar consistency. the other mixer flavors are much better.
0	my baby and i both loved the stage 1 happy baby pouches that we tried , so i had high hopes for this as well. to my dismay , it smelled like cat food and was gritty. i expected there to be more morsels of food , but this was just mush. my son took a few bites and refused to eat any more.
0	anyone see where theses are made ? - i am avoiding treats from china because of all the problems lately. and i do not see a country of origin here.
0	used it a couple of times over the course of a month , and it worked great ! third time , high pitched noise , and no mic signal coming through. not too surprising , given how flimsy this thing feels. this is apparently a known issue , just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. &apos; nuff said !
1	best k-cup hot cocoa on the market , bar none. would not be without it in the house , especially with the winter months coming.
1	i have been eating panda licorice for a number of years and it is hard for someone who loves licorice to eat any other brand. this is all natural ( which is what makes it taste great ) from the licorice root. fresh always because of the unique packaging and the most flavorful.
1	the mahogany has a smooth full bodied character. i highly recommend this coffee to drinkers looking for a bold but not overpowering taste !
1	i ordered this product for a themed baby shower. they went over well and they tasted just like normal cracker jacks. loved that i could find the box and they fit perfect in favor bags.
0	if you like to taste the &quot; flavor &quot; in your flavored coffee , skip this one. i &apos;ve struggled to taste the creme caramel flavoring that is supposed to be in here. the coffee flavor is also slightly bitter , but that could just be my taste buds longing for some flavoring ! i &apos;d recommend green mountain , gloria jeans or van houtte brands before this one.
0	i opened the box with the 3 cans of peanuts and all 3 cans had a large dent on the side. there was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. at least the peanuts were ok. maybe we are being sold &quot; seconds &quot; through amazon by this company. buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company.
1	my daughter loves these snacks and can &apos;t get them in china where she is working now so i ordered them for her. very satisfied and she was very appreciative.
1	wow this chocolate raspberry flavored coffee is the absolute best we have ever had and i can honestly say we have tried quite a few in our time. and of course the price can &apos;t be beat unless you find someone who wants to sell you some that &quot; fell &quot; off the back of some delivery truck.
1	i ordered these to use for marathon training. i have a sensitive stomach , but have had no problems with these. they do give me energy during those long runs !
0	i buy jack links peppered jerky every month. i tried these as this was the first time seeing them. don &apos;t waste your money. they are so tough even the kids wouldnt eat them ! ! they do not taste anything like the other &quot; peppered &quot; jerkys. stick with the 1 oz or the 2 oz sticks they are moist and not so much grizzle.
1	the cake was a little smaller than i thought , but it was delicious. my husband and i enjoyed it so much , we are ordering more for christmas !
1	having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups , grove square &apos;s are by far the best. they are very chocolaty , rich , creamy , and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup. yum ...
1	the true test is that our cats really loves the grass we grow from these seeds ! and they grew very easily in pots , too.
0	bought a can yesterday from a local store. the expiration was 2013 , but it really smelled bad ! what am i supposed to do now ? open every single can and do a smell test before buying ?
1	&quot; these are delicious ! the chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. crunchy and not bitter. &quot; &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b00067ad4u &quot; &gt; chocolate covered espresso beans 5 pounds &lt; / a &gt;
1	delivered by ups , this product is just about perfect. it does not have a disagreeable smell and the dogs love it. it is much less expensive than prescription dogfood and our dogs are thriving on it. you can even see an occasional pea and / or carrot. no grain to worry about.
1	these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.there perfict for on the go.fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.and there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.the price of twelve dollars was very resonable.also there great for shareing.if you are looking for a mint try these ones.youll be glad you did.
1	a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition. everyone get the munchies .... is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips !
0	pan ducale almond biscotti were a disappointment to me , not because they were bad , but because they could not come close to the great lettieri prato belli cantuccini almond cookies. at best they are low in calories - also in almonds.
0	i was hoping this was a good idea. however we tried them even after i heard they tasted bitter like artificial sweetner and it was true. not the same as the stuff from the can.
0	i wanted to like this wine because i really like bethenny , but the wine just isn &apos;t good. it really tastes and smells like vinegar.
1	it is very strong and pure ! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. helps with digestion but the smell is strong ! !
1	i love this tea , seriously ! my mom and i suffer very bad with sinus problems and we heard about this tea called sinus busters . we just had to see what all the talk was about , you know . it is a very good tea that takes your blues away and make you sleep great . aloha !
1	love the snack. wanted to buy a bunch. &lt; p &gt; shipping at amazon is more than the price of the snack. try ordering a dozen and then look at the shipping price. &lt; p &gt; every link i &apos;ve tried to this snack takes you back to amazon &apos;s exhorbitant shipping rates. &lt; p &gt; another reason to buy your books at overstock.com. too back they don &apos;t carry food as well.
0	this product previously ordered and excellent but this time tasted old and was very hard---finally threw it away. still have not figured out how i ever got it in first place as ordered another product from amazon and somehow got this as well ? ? ? ? ?
1	if you &apos;re looking for a healthier alternative to peanut butter ( whatever reason ) this is a good choice. it &apos;s nice and crunchy , tastes better than other brands i &apos;ve tried , and doesn &apos;t separate as much as others. best i &apos;ve found so far.
1	i love how fast my cups arrived. i will always get my k cups here ! i can &apos;t wait to try something new.
0	i thought that this would be the perfect toy for my 100 lb lab who destroys kongs in about 3 days. but , to my surprise , he was interested in it for all of about 5 min. he chewed the rope part for a little bit but has not touched it since.
1	this can of juice was delicious. it reminded me of the orangina beverage. i did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with &quot; energy drinks &quot; like red bull since they market it as &quot; all natural &quot; . nevertheless , it &apos;s yummy and i recommend it !
0	we loved this popcorn but come on shipping is way over the top we would settle next time for something we can buy but not spend 3 times on shipping
1	these are my most favorite nut snacks. sunflower is my absolute favorite , but the almond , cashew ( very buttery and rich ) , and seasame are really great , too. have given as gifts and everyone follows up to ask me where they can buy them. great for the kiddos , too !
1	i bought two types of edible glitter to decorate a plain cake. this one was by far the most stunning. the other silver went on grey ( not that appetizing ) whereas this one had tonnes of sparkle and really made a statement. highly recommended. nice fast delivery too.
0	i have enjoyed creme brulee on many occasions and thought that this coffee would provide a hint of that delicious dessert. it has a strange and unpleasant aftertaste. if , after tasting this coffee , someone offered me a menu featuring creme brulee for dessert , i would avoid it at all costs. there is no flavor in this coffee that bears any resemblance to creme brulee.
1	although this isn &apos;t a perfect cup of cocoa , it &apos;s far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again.
0	i bought this for my dog and he took one look at it played with it for a few minutes and never looked at it again- it was a waste of money .. it did not interested him at all .. so disappointed ...
0	this sugar is way different than the regular sugar. it has a bad after taste. also you need to use more of this to sweeten anything than the regular sugar.
0	i love lemonade but this product does not taste good. i noticed a bad aftertaste. my husband and kids did not like the true lemon lemonade either. i do like the lemon juice packets.
0	was excited about this tough toy , but gave it to our 96 lb puppy who tore the rope apart in less than an hour. he is usually really good with toys that dispense treats but this time since he couldn &apos;t figure out the pulling , because it wasn &apos;t really working , he just decided to chew the rope. threw it away because it was also too noisy and scratching up the wood floors.
0	too much of a good thing ? we worked this kibble in over time , slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural. by this time , the cats couldn &apos;t keep it in or down. what a mess. we &apos;ve moved on.
0	i am big coffee lover. this was some of the worst coffee i have ever had. it smells wonderful but the taste is horrible. i would not recommend purchasing this coffee at all.
0	you would think that something as simple as yellow mustard would be impossible to ruin , but this company seemed to do so. i will never buy this again what a waste of 27 $ for subscribe and save. i don &apos;t know one guy seemed to this it , it tastes bad to me.
1	the chips were delicious. i didn &apos;t care much for the vinegar flavored chip but the other flavors were great. didn &apos;t have any guilt eating this healthier snack.
1	this mix makes the most delicious pancakes ! my gluten eating family wanted mine instead of theirs ! i have also make sausage balls and biscuits for biscuits and gravy with it ! so good !
1	i , myself , do not care for licorice but my husband thinks this is the best licorice he has ever had and he loves the stuff. i have also given it to two friends who are licorice lovers and they say it is delicious.
1	this replaces many of other brands of pizza crust mix , cake mix , foccaccia and more. the only reason i don &apos;t give it 5 stars is that it is slightly pricey , but that is an issue of living gluten free. enjoy and be creative with it.
0	terrible. half of the rinds don &apos;t cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink. contacted lowrey &apos;s about the defective product but they failed to respond.
0	purchased these for first time. no second time. the beans will not soften up nor will the pasta.
1	easy to use and saves money. gives you control on the strength of your coffee. i will purchase them again.
1	we love melitta coffee pods. makes a perfect cup of coffee every time. the coffee is always delicious , even the decaf blend ! if you have a coffee pod machine , try all of their blends ... they &apos;re great !
1	love this stuff ! i add some diced tomatoes and a pound of ground hamburger and this is great ! i take it to pot lucks a lot.
0	i expected better from a premium maine chowder. this is no better than , say , snow &apos;s , which you can get for less than half the price. not bad , but not worth the money.
0	do not buy product contain gelatin. gelatin in baby food ? ? ? why gerber ? ? ? , do not buy if you follow vegetarian or kosher / halal regime.
1	at last- a decaf coffee that doesn &apos;t taste decaf ! smooth , rich , flavorful , with no bitter aftertaste. starbucks worthy ( but to my husband who doesn &apos;t care for starbucks , it &apos;s way better ) . we like to drink this in the evening and it &apos;s basically dessert with cream and sugar.
1	these chips are very good. wish we could purchase them in our area. great chance to try them in this offer.
0	sorry , as i stated on my other reviews my german breed , g.sheph. is very picky ... and he just did not care for the smell of these beef rolls , he did not even care to come close to take 2nd sniff .... sorry , no star ! ! ! but it triggered me to give it as least 1 star to continue my review.
1	popchips is a new product for me--ordered after seeing an ad in weight watchers magazine. loved the product. packing was perfect. shipping went fine. no complaints with this order at all. probably will order again soon !
1	bought 1 / 2 lb each of five different mo &apos;s fudge recently from a school fundraiser. i &apos;m not much of a chocolate fudge eater , prefer peanut butter , but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible. so rich and creamy ! almost too creamy. had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut. but if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover , this can !
0	i have ordered from this vendor before so was surprised to see that the k cup box was crushed this time. it may be the shipper that was at fault though since they were in a sturdy box with adequate packaging. the k cups were impacted though so i was not able to use them all.
1	my dogs give this a high-five. i &apos;ve never tried it , but the list of ingredients is sound and it make their tails wag.
0	my golden doodle chewed through the rope within 2 days. i thought it was going to be a great interactive toy for him but it was not. clever boy chewed through the rope so that the treats poured out ! lol
1	good tasting and the pricing is pretty good. it &apos;s always sold out on keurig.com , so i come here to make this purchase , i love dark chocolate ! reason for 4 stars , the pricing isn &apos;t great but it &apos;s okay.
0	this is the worst &quot; coffee &quot; i have ever tasted .... i am extrememly disappointed in this product. puroast house blend tastes like chickory ~ no coffee smell , no coffee taste ~ and no returns ! now i am stuck with a $ 22. bag of beans.
0	i love coffee , i love mochas , i love amaretto. this product however was disgusting ! ! !
1	i &apos;m a big coffee drinker , and this melitta cafe offering is rich with no bitterness. sometimes decaf coffee has a funny , oily aftertaste , but this coffee had none of that unpleasantness. highly recommended.
1	as a person who love cinnamon scent and flavor , i find this tea amazing. i was used to drinking the plain black tea at work and this blend is a nice change from that. i can probably only have one or two cups a day because it is pretty sweet but i will continue to drink it probably every day. enjoy
1	this product makes a great gift ! not only are the cookies delicious , but the tin is attractive and of good quality. highly recommended.
1	first package was lost in the mail , but jr shipped a backup at no charge with 24 hour shipment ! ! ! !
1	it &apos;s a lot of cookies , but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store. the packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh. my order from january 25th has an expiration date of april 28th. not bad , but i would have preferred a later expiration date. other than that , no problems. exactly the same chips ahoy you would buy in the store.
1	if you enjoy a rich flavored cheddar cheese with a bite of horseradish , i would give this a try. it was a instant party favorite when i brought this and crackers to friends house. i would recommend this to anyone !
0	i received the package early tonight and it was finely packed. despite that , these bars taste awful ! i bet the chocolate cover is of the worst quality - no better than crewing wax ; not even mention the god-knows-what that fills in it ! how can it rank the first among all nutrition bars ! i really want to rate it with no star if it &apos;s allowed !
0	these sell for .89 cents at the grocery store. how many are they selling for $ 5 here ?
0	i don &apos;t know. maybe i &apos;m just not putting the right &quot; yummy goodness &quot; inside. this toy , though durable and a novel idea , doesn &apos;t hold either of my dogs &apos; interest. not even our beagle ( who tells everyone she &apos;s starving and we never feed her ... ever ! ) seems to be interested in this for any length of time.
1	this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. it has a powerful flavor and you don &apos;t need much of it to zest up a dish. i add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day. i will buy this product again and again.
1	quality food but the price is very high. luv amazon &apos;s free ship over $ 25.
0	i have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. i do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. dha from fish oil is fine , but the lady who answered my phone told me that all dha gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. do infants need gelatin at this age ?
1	i am on weight watchers and these chips are only 3 points and they taste great. i like every kind , i use the plain chips to dip with my salsa. i would recomend these chips to everyone weight watchers or not.
1	this ground coffee is almost as good as fresh-ground coffee beans. my husband is a coffee snob and he loves this coffee. i have to admit the fresh ground is better , but yuban makes a really good ground coffee. don &apos;t waste your money on folger &apos;s or maxwell house , this is the best ground coffee out there.
1	this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat. my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl. i &apos;m 30 now and i love it !
0	i bought this tea during a major sinus infection crisis which included headache , earache , toothache. i drink multiple cups over a few days , and am sad to report it had absolutely no effect. taste is so-so , but that &apos;s not really what matters. as every sinus sufferer knows , if eating dirt would make the pain go away , we &apos;d eat dirt.
1	the main reason i drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening. my caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning ... only one cup. so this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since i won &apos;t get wound up. flavor is good , packaged well , easy to brew.
0	these pork rinds by lowery &apos;s suck. i have tried to leave a review , but it appears that amazon.com has their heads as far up their a * * es as lowery &apos;s. i don &apos;t expect to see this posted.
0	my dogs love the taste of it. my worry is the next day one of them vomit the entire food he just ate plus the one from the previous day. i have to said i did not gradually change to this food , so maybe that is the reason. but i notice lots of urine more than normal. i just don &apos;t feel comfortable feeding this food to my dogs.
1	delicious. reminds me exactly of the corn cake they use to serve at their restaurants. i make this with every mexican night we have at home.
1	love these ! pancakes were something i missed the most after going on a gluten-free diet 8 years ago , until now ... these are fantastic ! : - ) thank you for making them. i love amazon mom &apos;s because i get these shipped monthly. thank you !
0	warning : this is a strong flavor. i thought that this would be blue mountain-y ... oh no. it is like ... rum flavored or something. yuk.
0	the flavor combination of the ketchup chips was very good. however , the coating was applied so heavily that the chips were gritty , and thickly encrusted with it. the flavoring grit coated my lips and mouth with grit and crumbled and fell off all over my clothes. messy and unpleasant. needs lighter flavor coating.
1	i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all , its also the best taste , others taste like medicine , this one has a tea fresh taste. i love it.
0	both of my cats vomit from all temptations treats , but especially the hairball variety. one of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn &apos;t before. i &apos;ve tried all of them , and minutes after they eat their treats they vomit. this doesn &apos;t happen with any other treats like whisker lickins or pounce.
0	didnt really like this oil , i know its good for your health , but didnt like the taste when added to food , or when i made a dressing for salad. smoked up the house , when i cooked some fish in a pan with it , even on medium heat.
1	great flavor , and texture. it may not be the best jerky out there , but for the price , i couldn &apos;t find any better. it comes in a few different flavors , so there &apos;s bound to be one you like. i just wish the shelf life was longer , i &apos;d love to keep this with the emergency food / water.
1	these are a great size and healthy. they satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
1	newman &apos;s own food is one of the best on the market. it is a natural healthy food for my senior dog.
0	i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked. i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. so i don &apos;t know why these were different. will never buy these chips from here again.
0	my dog loved it at first but an hour later the plastic bottle cracked ! ! maybe this toy should be kept &quot; indoors &quot; only : (
0	i love chia , but i have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid. the expiration dates were over a year away. amazon doesn &apos;t allow food returns , and navitas said i would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones. i will still enjoy chia , but i &apos;ll avoid this brand from now on.
1	these vanilla beans are so fragrant that you can smell them through the unopened package ! i used them to make my own vanilla extract as christmas gifts , and they worked great ! don &apos;t be fooled by the product photo : they look stiff and dry in the image , but they &apos;re soft , pliable , and moist with vanilla oil.
1	this product does a great job of clearing out the kidneys. it has helped make my husband feel lots better even though he is in early renal failure.
1	this is a delicious recipe and ingredients and the one i use. a bit pricy but if you don &apos;t mind the price point it makes a wonderful waffle. combine this with a waring waffle maker and you could be in waffle heaven.
1	i recently received the variety packs of popchips. i have them delivered to work and everyone just loves them. i tried one flavor ... delicious , next flavor .... excellent , next flavor ... oh my goodness , even better and it gets better and better. best snack in recent memory. : )
0	didn &apos;t not like this at all. didn &apos;t taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash. i don &apos;t recommend at all. i rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal. it comes out just right.
1	i have a habit of trying everything myself before offering it to my lo. with this product i am sure that i am providing my lo with good nutrition and good taste. he simply loves it .
0	i used to love this tea. i would drink it every morning but than the stores i would buy it from stopped selling it , so i decided to buy a case of it on amazon. i don &apos;t know what changed , but it is absolutely awful now. it has none of the flavors in it that i use to love so much ... and i &apos;ll unfortunately probably never buy it again
1	if you want hot peanuts , this is your product. i have tried several other brands , and these peanuts seem to pack the most punch and have a fantastics taste.
1	sooo happy amazon sells this ! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing ! ! ! ! this is delicious ! ! ! perfect for a fiesta night !
1	i am very happy with the disposacup single serve brewers. the item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect packaging. now i can brew my favorite brand of coffee anytime i want.
0	i love liquor-filled chocolates. i received these as a gift and found the gel-like liquor not to be very strong. it was almost as if the liquor had been cut with sweet syrup and all the alcohol cooked out. a young child wouldn &apos;t even get a buzz from these. the chocolate itself was ok -- better than hershey &apos;s and nestle but not as good as godiva or lindt.
0	this gum is the worst i have ever purchased , plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone !
0	the service and delivery from amazon was great. however , the product itself is not worth buying. no matter what i try , coffee leaks out around the kcup when brewing .... it makes a mess ! wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee ( tim hortons ) , but guess i &apos;ll just have to get used to other brands !
0	i bought this for my puggle ( pug / beagle mix ) because he loves to chew on empty soda bottles. the bottle part is very tough , but he had the rope part destroyed within an hour. i expected more from it than that. without the rope , it &apos;s just not the same. i consider this to have been a waste of money.
1	this stuff is great because it &apos;s low glycemic. substitute this to sugar and you &apos;ll be doing your body a great favor. this size is economical and shipping is fast , too. i got mine very soon.
0	i was looking for a replacement for knorr &apos;s carbonara sauce mix because the grocery stores don &apos;t carry it anymore in my area. wagner &apos;s is creamy enough , but it doesn &apos;t have the bacon flavor that i have come to expect in carbonara. i don &apos;t recommend it unless you add your own bacon.
0	if you are going to eat potatoes , go organic and the real thing ... not in a can. big mistake. i like some canned foods but potatoes are a few miles away where you can get the real thing , cheap.
0	van houtte chocolate raspberry truffle lack the rasberry taste , which was what i was shopping for.
1	this is the best flour for home made pizza. it has the best tasting crust i have found. it works best in a super hot oven if you don &apos;t have a pizza oven.
1	simple , plug-in setup. garageband recognizes it right away , as long as it &apos;s opened as first step , before plugging in icicle. nice , clean , &quot; transparent &quot; sound without much coloring with my electrovoice stage mic. depending upon your setup , you may have to crank up your inputs and headphone volumes to get comfortable levels. blue recommends plugging directly into computer. a great little device for the price !
0	$ 10 for a single serving is high compared to the price offered from nutrisystem themselves. also , despite being listed as from nutrisystem , our package came from a separate source.
1	this is great coconut water and there is no added sugar. its all natural and they use ripe coconut not young coconut.
1	i love asparagus. up until very recently , i had never had pickled asparagus. oh my goodness , when a friend introduced me to this exact brand , i couldn &apos;t believe how great stuff tasted. i loved it so much i bought the six pack. i &apos;ve got 2 jars left. gonna need more ! !
0	sweet , but almost no rhubard flavor. bargain supermarket brands have more flavor. i will not be buying this product again. i will not be buying this product again.
1	great stuff ! love that it &apos;s organic and raw. but later saw same thing @ tj &apos;s for less than half the price !
1	these beef jerky strips are really good. texture is just right. flavor is peppery , but also just right. could be more smoky for me. this is a repeat buy on my part.
1	i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. excellent quality , and no need to &apos; dress it up &apos; . i put it the micro on about 20 % power for 1 minute and shazam ! i believe a little heating brings out the flavor.
1	fresh , a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories. they taste just like chocolate pudding.
1	these are delicious and filling. i first had them in hawaii a few weeks ago but then couldn &apos;t find them when i got back home to philly. amazon had them and a good selection. if you are a seed and nut eater and like a crispy cracker you will love these. enjoy !
1	gave these as a gift to my brother. we are both fans of hot sauces so i thought i &apos;d give this a try. the wooden packaging looked nice and was sturdy enough that it could be used for storage / transport of the sauces. my brother says that he liked the sauces , he would not share with me on chirstmas day so i never got a chance to try them.
1	i was so happy to see that someone realized that the kcup is a product in a lot of homes. these disposable kcups make using ground coffee a simple clean and easy way to enjoy a favorite coffee , tea or hot chocolate beverage easy i work as a merchandiser and am always searching to find the new products and making sure that i can reccomend the products to the customers and stores that i service
1	i love peppermint , but find hard candy just too strong. these melt in your mouth and aren &apos;t overwhelming and don &apos;t leave an aftertaste.
1	i purchased this item for a cake that called for gold dust , never thought i would find it , but im glad i did. when i sprinkled it on it looked like a shining star. the container is small but it will go a long way. worth buying.
1	when i was in high school , my mother would always have these around the house. living in the dorms , i usually only ever find small , overpriced packages of chocolate covered rasins. this is perfect for satisfying my cravings ! it stores very well - i &apos;ve had mine about a month and they taste the same as when i first opened them - delicious !
0	raving reviews made me buy this for dogs. i have a lab mix a beagle and 2 shepards that i got from impoundment and they &apos;re not spoiled. one chewed it to crumbles but left it on the ground and my shepards have been burying them in the backyard. i wasted my money on this one.
1	good , light taste. not too strong of a flavoring , and very little , if any , aftertaste. they go down easy , ... mmmmm. definitely happy with the purchase.
1	great service ! items arrived faster than expected. very efficient ! will use this seller again. i highly recommend this seller ! thank you for the excellent service !
0	my german shepherd took less than 1 minute to take off each cover and that included the time to eat the treat. i was looking for more of a challenge for him. guess he is one of the too smart for his own good , or at least too smart for this toy. the one star is for my dog , it might work well for others.
0	this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. there were no tears in the packages.
0	sorry to all you champurrado fans , this is not the real deal , but an artificial version , and way too sweet. please compare to others &apos; hecho en mexico &apos; , and get yourself a &apos; molinillo &apos; while you &apos;re at it ! ps : i use almond milk to make mine !
1	just the right amount of spice to make them hot and they are also sweet ! very hard to find in new jersey. can not have just one bag around ! !
0	when tea is decaffeinated , is all the flavor removed ? or is this just lousy tea ? in any case , all you get from a couple of these tea bags in a ( 12 oz. ) mug of hot water is--hot water ! true , the hot water is slightly brownish after five minutes of steeping , but there &apos;s no tea flavor at all. very disappointing.
0	the carbonation in this drink was way too much. so much in fact , that it over powered the flavor. ( orange-tangerine is usually very good together ) . i expect this from a soda , but not a &quot; healthy &quot; drink. lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. until then , i &apos;ll pass.
0	i was given a track number and told it was delivered to my pobox. it never happened. i received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder.
1	i tried this and i found it too salty. plus i ate this fish sauce with some fish but i realized it was kind of redundant. i &apos;m kidding , of course. this stuff is great !
0	i don &apos;t like illy. it is under roasted. if you like starbucks , peets your not going to like this. but then if you hate starbucks you just may like it. i like my beans almost burnt.
0	it &apos;s hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free. these crackers are a poor substitute. they don &apos;t have a good taste- just starchy and , well , blah. no amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it. i recommend crunchmasters multigrain gf crackers. they are the best that i have found.
1	most caribou coffees are too weak for me. this one is a delicious exception. it &apos;s right up there with revv , emeril &apos;s bold , or van houtte &apos;s eclipse. a dark bold coffee without tasting burned or bitter.
1	i would call this a summer wine-light with strong pear notes. almost clear in color. nice finish and a good wine for those who don &apos;t really like wine.
1	my baby loves these dinners. they are very flavorful and not bland like other baby food that we have tried. i love the fact that they are organic and amazon sells them at such a great price.
1	very good popcorn ! i believe even better than orville &apos;s brand. a little on the expensive side but you do get a lot of popcorn.
0	it clearly states on the description , pack of 6 ! but i only got 5 ! and i cannot find how to complain about this. i don &apos;t want to return.
1	local grocery stores don &apos;t carry this cereal so i order it. it is full of nuts , raisins , and other great stuff. i cut up a banana in it instead of adding sugar. my favorite box cereal.
1	great chips - no after taste ... seem to be much better for me. need to buy the big bags now.
1	i love these banana cookies even though i can eat any other brand / ingredient. yes , the texture is different , but that &apos;s what i really like about them. it kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry , melt in your mouth texture. they are really expensive compared to name / store brand cookies , so i have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days : (
0	save your money and do not buy this product. does not even come close to bacon flavor more like a hickory smoke taste. after everyone in my family tried it we all agreed it was nasty ( we &apos;re not picky either ) .
1	love these soy nuts , especially the garlic and onion blend ! ! ! ! perfect for taking to a party or just snacking on while on the go. been happy with every product from truson.
1	i dont take it to lose weight , this is a laxative tea , as all the ones labeled &quot; weight loss tea &quot; .i &apos;m very constipated and taking this tea everyday has helped me very much , with no cramps or other negative effects. it &apos;s strong and dont recommend it for ocassional constipation or for losing weight. warning : when it works you &quot; have &quot; to go.
0	first , the product pictured is not what you get. what you really get is are tiny packets called &quot; sticks &quot; suitable for flavoring bottled water. the box doesn &apos;t even say what size bottle it is sized for. i &apos;m not keeping it so i can &apos;t tell you how it tastes.
0	after finding out whats in beggin strips these were recommended to me by a client. i am a dog groomer. my standard poodle had two this morning and has been vomiting along with diarrhea all day .. enough said ..
1	this jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag , but it &apos;s one of the few i &apos;ve found that is salty enough and doesn &apos;t contain a bunch of sweeteners. the smoke flavor is also pronounced. unfortunately , the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me.
1	i was delighted to find this product online , because i cannot always find it in the stores. however , each package i have opened thus far is at least half reduced to crumbs because of poor packaging for shipping. i doubt that i will order more using this method.
0	my baby didn &apos;t seem into these dinners , so i tried them. they &apos;re not terrible , but not good either. we &apos;ll stick with the eb fruits and veggies until she &apos;s ready for table foods.
1	i recently moved and couldn &apos;t find a thai restaurant nearby. my favorite meal at my old thai place was massaman curry. i used the recipe on the back on the package when i got it , and it was just like what i get at the restaurant ! excellent flavor !
0	tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. these sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. im used to eating glazier &apos;s pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. guess i will stick to what i like.
0	my whole family ( 7 people ) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet. very disappointed that product has sucralose. i wouldn &apos;t buy it again
0	i &apos;ve had my keurig for about two years. i drink one cup every morning. every time i run out of a type of coffee , i buy a box of something different. this is the first box i have actually thrown away. i would recommend just about any other coffee out there for the keurig.
1	arrived on time , smells like a good addition to my baking supplies. came in excellent condition. will use in syrups , etc.
0	i don &apos;t trust dog treats made in china. as an alternative , there &apos;s a good chicken jerky dog treat made by goodness gracious - in the usa and using 100 % human grade chicken. &#91; ... &#93;
1	we received a gift box that contained the stonewall farms pancake mix and they were out of this world. they are the lightest , fluffy and flavorful pancakes and waffles you will ever taste. and the price on amazon is a big savings over ordering from stonewall farms. don &apos;t shy away from the larger size and the two pack because you will devour these pancakes in no time.
1	these papers are great , they leave a delicious strawberry taste on your lips. even the glue tastes good.
1	this has been a christmas favorite since my late sister-in-law introduced our family to these cookies over 20 years ago. she was from italy and loved these cookies as do we.
0	i thought i ordered a bold decaf but this is what was delivered. i opened one to try it out and do not like it but am now stuck with it because i opened the box. this product needs to be labeled properly and clearly. if you like a mild roast , this is for you.
1	my daughter absolutely loves this stuff and she is a very picky eater. it is also hard to find in the supermarket.
0	i bought these seeds in the hope they would be what i &apos;m used to. i &apos;m sorry i did. the seed pods are extremely small , they &apos;re a re past prime , and somewhat bitter than normal cardamom. disappointed with this product from this seller.
1	a little costly but they are good and fresh too , not stale at all. would recomend to any cheetos fan.
1	i love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. it has been very hard to find in any stores. i am so glad i found it on amazon. the shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. it still has the same flavor after all of these years. try this candy if you love coconut. you will love it too !
0	i wasn &apos;t thrilled because i had to pick out tiny bits of gravel. the flax seeds themselves were fine , top quality. if it weren &apos;t for the gravel bits ( that get through the sieve w / the seeds , i guess ? ) , this would get 5 stars.
0	i decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. however , this formula made him more gassy ... the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. i tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn &apos;t work.
1	this is by far my favorite black licorice - and the list of ingred. could not possibly be shorter or better ! now if i could learn how to not eat the whole box in one sitting ...
1	i sent two babkas to a friend as a thank you. he is a big seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babka. he said the babkas were delicious ! ! !
1	i prefer stong coffee but my husband does not like it quite so strong. it works well for me. the way he made it work for him , he makes a cup and a half and that suits him. it also makes the kcup last twice as long !
1	these arrived securely packaged , not even a chip on one lollipop. they also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister &apos;s baby shower. i would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers !
1	found these while looking for good , cheap , low-calorie snack packs to buy in bulk for my office. after my first shipment , i decided to have two boxes shipped to the office monthly via subscribe &amp; save. my next shipment arrives in two days. i &apos;m so excited ! gotta have my pop chips ...
0	two of aunt gussie &apos;s cookies contain 23 % of daily fat allowance ! the cookies are so full of grease they fall apart. they may be sugar free and gluten free , but they make it up with mostly fat ! i can &apos;t even give them to my grandchildren !
0	illy is the best coffee if your not mixing you own blend of different brands as i have prior , but at almost double price that i get from any local store this is insane.
1	i absolutely love the oreo thin crisps cookies &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000f9z1wi &quot; &gt; oreo thin crisps 100 calorie packs , 6-count boxes ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt; . they taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet.
1	it &apos;s a great product- especially if you like garlic ! no need for &quot; slicing &amp; dicing ! ( which is a good thing when your right side is &quot; stroke paralized &quot; ! ) just garlic too- not an &quot; oily &amp; salty product &quot; just plain or roasted garlic ! and it lasts a long time too !
1	i cannot tell you how many of these i made between thanksgiving and christmas ! fast , convenient and so delicious ! i got rave reviews ! thanks !
0	i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it. he wouldn &apos;t eat it , and when he did , it gave him terrible diarrhea. we will not be buying this again. it &apos;s also super expensive.
1	the chips are good with fast service but i ordered a case ( 24 ) of popchips 6-flavor variety pack and received 24 bags all barbecue flavored.
0	by the time i received this product all 3 packages were melted so all had to be thrown away because everything in each bag had melted together
0	i thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section , but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when i opened each bag. slim jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good.
0	well , i opened it and it is grayish sticky mess. i &apos;m so mad at myself for wasting my money , and not trying to make it from scratch at home. which would probably end up better and cheaper. oh well , live and learn !
0	i think a better description of all non-traditional , gummy products as these are needed to eliminate confusion. these gummy s , as the other single fruit line are covered in crystallized sugar , and are more of a sweet candy. traditional gummbybears are asoft in and out single source candy , the one we had as kids , these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy.
1	the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor. it is clean and really fresh ! perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich. the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried. it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy !
1	tasted good. spicy. those that don &apos;t like spicy should stay away from this. for the price paid , very good buy.
0	my initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive ! however , after a week , the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo. i had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage. do not buy !
1	in this age where even basic service no longer exists , i was pleasantly surprised when my transaction actually came off without a hitch. shipped on time , and the product was in good condition. well done !
0	this product used to be excellent. recently its quality has gone way down and they changed the box ... it makes no sense why they &apos;d change their best tea like that.
1	the product is exactly what it is portrayed to be. tasty ( not yummy ) but good. i received the product promptly. i ordered 2 cases and will eat every package.
0	unfortunately , all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong. these are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages ( as stated further down in the description ) . they are .08oz packages. very disappointed in this fact. cherryheads are tasty , though , and the shipping was fast.
1	love this juice. scheduled shipment is convenient and economical. this is a very expensive beverage and any way to save some money on it , is worth it
1	i love popchips , the bag now has only 100 calories. and it bit smaller but if you are craving pop chips without the fat and still taste great. these are for you. a bit pricey but worth it.
1	i just recently had to go gluten free and have been disappointed by the gluten free flours and baking mixes. i bought this and it &apos;s amazing ! just like the original bisquick. although it is cheaper at walmart.
1	this food is great. my 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since i changed her food. i highly recommend this dog food.
0	the taste is horrible , and the boost in energy was not worth adding more of it to my drink. for now , i &apos;ll be sticking with 5-hr energy.
1	this popcorn is great , and even comes in smart pop at lower calories. i always have both for the me and the grandkids.
1	really gets the mouth watering , a little over $ 3.00 at big5 , the price listed here is insane !
0	plant was dead on arrival and was mangled in its container , probably better to buy one locally. i dont think its gonna make it ....
0	don &apos;t waste your money. this was a ruined christmas gift for my sister. she loved these as a child , so i got her a box for a surprise. they were so stale that we couldn &apos;t even eat one package. they tasted like cardboard-what a disappointment ! ! !
1	they are very hard to find but whenever i do i try to stock up. great flavor , perfect for munching on and still pretty healthy. highly recommended.
0	these were kind of expensive for a dog treat and two of my dogs wouldn &apos;t even touch them , so i doubt i would buy them again.
0	we bought this to replace our cafe escapes dark chocolate cocoa. they are less expensive- but you get what you pay for. this cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste. i do not recommend it. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b005k4q1t0 &quot; &gt; grove square hot cocoa cups , dark , single serve cup for keurig k-cup brewers , 24-count &lt; / a &gt;
1	what &apos;s to say - pop chips are great ! ! ! kudos to the pop chip makers.
1	this is by far my favorite licorice .... to the point i have a case delivered on a regular monthly basis ...... an option offered by amazon ...... a very convenient service ......
0	consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable , to low
1	ordered 2 cases on different dates and got them within 2 days. cant find these in the stores so please keep them in stock. make for a great meal with some veggies or a salad ... and this type of fish with omega 3 &apos;s is good for you.
1	if you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand. i &apos;ll eat these instead of chips any day !
1	needed the soap b-4 weekend. ordered on thurs and paid the extra next day shipping ( even though i &apos;m prime ) because no delivery here on sat ) . stuff came s promised on friday and in good package. the price of the soap , like lots of other stuff nowadays on amazon , was higher than local stores so ck prices first. amazon aint the lowest , usually , anymore.
0	these peanuts are rock hard. i ate a handful of peanuts and got a bad stomach ache. they don &apos;t taste bad , and not salty at all. i don &apos;t understand why they are so hard. ouch. i love the peanuts from costco. they are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach. must go back to them.
1	i &apos;m a big fan of the carbs , fat and protein balance of these crisps. the salt isn &apos;t overpowering and the taste is ok. i &apos;ve had better soy chips ( genisoy tortilla chips ) but these are alright if you don &apos;t like the crunch of a chip.
1	what a fun winter treat ! this is a perfect cup of cocoa in seconds ! we like to put a tablespoon or two of heavy whipping cream in the bottom of mug before brewing ! a family favorite.
1	love this mix for pancakes ! many gf products have other ingredients i &apos;m allergic to , so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting. i make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave later. just had the yummy cheeseburger pie for dinner last night , recipes can be found on bettycrocker.com.
1	i like these better than the regular altoids , but they &apos;re even more costly , so you &apos;d better like them.
1	my cat loved this food for a long time. however , he has been picky lately. it &apos;s been harder and harder to get him to eat this , but the variety offered in this cat food is good and seemed to keep my cat healthy !
0	in terms of taste , it is not the one i want to re-order. i can &apos;t tell if it really can boost one &apos;s immune system though !
0	this is an awful coffee. the flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.
1	this stuff taste just like flavored carbonated water. in this case flavored with orange and tangerine. i imagine it &apos;s better for you than plain soda. i really found it tasty. it has a strong citrus flavor that i preferred to some of the other flavors.
0	last two purchases : the oatmeal was green and had a very peculiar taste to it. i am hoping the company checks their product more carefully as there have been many moms who have lost confidence in this product.
0	i have been working through all of the sodastream flavor offerings. this is the first i have truly not cared for. it has a chemical taste to it that really put me off of it. i tried the regular and it was just fair , but the diet-which i have loved all their other offering so far--just did not work in my opinion.
1	got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup , which is half the price of my local grocery stores , plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can &apos;t escape for a real meal. this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.
0	i prefer the reg. stevia pkts. from this company as opposed to the liquid flavors. had a funky taste to it.
1	i absolutely love this product - being able to have pancakes was my original goal - however - i made the pizza with it &amp; was absolutely thrilled about the pizza these are small boxes ( makes two pizzas per box ) , but i would highly recommend - i am reordering a pack of three now !
1	yes , you should order this drink because it does taste great. ( as long as price is no object ) tastes like orange juice with seltzer water. but dont feel guilty about drinking it because it is 100 % juice !
0	my chihuahuas like this treat , but they do not eat it with enthusiasm. they hesitate and let it sit quite often.
1	i am from england and i was raised on this custard. if you like vanilla custard / pudding you will love this. it &apos;s rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste. i love that it comes in a big canister and i can make as much as i want to. i would never make a trifle with anything else.
1	i &apos;ve been a fan of this stuff for years. make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top. it is quick , easy , and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don &apos;t feel like going out for lunch.
0	this gizmo is huge ! if it weren &apos;t so much trouble i &apos;d send it back. looks like a great product for a st. bernard , but for my 13-pound shih tzu it &apos;s overkill. there may be a smaller version , but i can only imagine what the hard plastic would sound like on my tile floors !
1	local availability of the plain variety of these crackers has been unpredictable with stores trimming inventory and dropping all but the highest volume skus. buying on subscription makes it affordable and , so far , reliable.
1	my family is on the last box. my oldest daughter ate most of the cookies. she likes peanut butter more than anything , and these 100-calorie pouches had just the right amount and they taste great.
0	bits of &quot; clam ? &quot; ( not sure ) in water with something i assume is potatoes. whose recipe is this ? save your money get something worth having. how do so many like this ? ! it &apos;s awful ! if you prefer real clam chowder and not seawater with something floating in it do not buy this !
0	i did not want this item and it was placed in my order by error and the item cannot be canceled. this is unacceptable when i do not want the item. how can this be taken off my bill ?
1	dandelion root is reported to aid in reducing high blood pressure , which is why i drink it. i &apos;ve pretty much given up coffee drinking and this is a tasty substitute , though one must acquire a taste for it. at home i use bulk roasted root but these tea bags are fantastic during travel.
1	this hot chocolate is very good. it has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. the price is a very good deal and more than worth it !
0	this just did not smell or taste like real olive oil. and the smoke point was lower than it should have been. perhaps it was a bad batch , diluted with some other oil , but i &apos;ll never use it again.
1	we used to buy this sauce at our local grocery store which closed in september. luckily , we were able to find it at amazon. you do have to buy a 6-pack but the expiration date is march 2012. habanero peppers give it a kick even though it has no onions. i &apos;m allergic to onions so this is a welcome product. very hard to find any good sauce with no onions.
0	our two dogs are not really interested in this toy , it has pretty much sat in their toy box since we bought it for them. not sure why , they seem to like most toys. it is very durable from what i can tell though.
1	these chocolates are absolutely the best , smooth in taste and almost delicate in texture. their an absolute must for any chocolate fan , i &apos;ve never been a fan of milk chocolate , but these fazer chocolates are the absolute exception ! i highly recommend these chocolates to anyone who loves chocolate as much as i do !
0	reese changed their cheesy popcorn seasoning. it is more salt than cheese. in fact it has very little cheese flavor left. i will not be purchasing this product again.
1	my cats love this food. for the money it is a great product. i get it every month. the cats love the flavor.
0	the aroma is pleasant , and flavor is nice and smooth , but it is very , very weak. i really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save , but i just cannot recommend it. even making smaller cups it is very weak. i &apos;m going to stick to newman &apos;s own organics extra bold as my go to k-cup for now.
1	who ever is making french &apos;s potato sticks , keep it up ! they are the best ! french &apos;s should have keep them in their line.mike
1	these are ok. i like the sweet potato ones better and both have good fiber content.
0	i can &apos;t eat these oats , they have a funny taste to them. my kids also think they taste funny. my husband thinks they are ok , so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own !
1	even my kids like this. they are always asking for hot cocoa. its not too sweet and very chocolaty. it is not super high in sugar or calories so its a great little treat. enjoy !
0	the flavor of these pods is horrid. i ordered them only because senseo was out of stock for so long , and i needed some decaf pods , and these had received a couple good reviews ( which i now suspect were written by baronet employees ) . i have never tasted such awful coffee before. a big &quot; yuk &quot; for baronet.
0	coffee beans did not seem fresh. no oil on them what so ever. i have tasted much better and fresher. will not order again.
0	looks like and tastes like chocolate colored water. no chocolate flavor whatsoever , this was a complete disappointment. i got the hot chocolate k-cups from swiss miss instead. how people can be giving this product four and five stars is astounding to me , is the amazon ratings system being gamed for this product ?
1	just the same thing i use to buy in the stores but for less. same great taste , same great package. same eveything because it is the exact same thing , love is stuff. thanks
0	i &apos;m not a gourmet coffee critic , but this stuff is disappointing. based upon previous good reviews , i suspect that the coffee in the k-cups i received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing. the wolfgang puck decaf i received is lifeless , watery , and tasteless. there &apos;s no aroma when it &apos;s brewing in the keurig. never again.
0	flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee , but i decided i &apos;d rather take massive doses of pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill.
1	this is good iced tea. it is hard to find locally in the fall and winter.
1	i ordered the disposakups because i have several coffees in bags that i had left over and wanted to use. the cups work great. i quickly figured out that the filter must be pushed down in order for the lid to fit. easy to load and easy to dispose.
1	my family and i are relatively new to gluten free and we have been in search of a baking mix to replace our weekend breakfasts. we have tried several others and they all taste &quot; gluten free &quot; , if you know what i mean. pamela &apos;s however , is so good and you can &apos;t tell its gluten free. try it , you won &apos;t regret it !
0	i have dogs who are 85 pounds. they chewed the bottle toy in less than 10 minutes ; trashed it. i have not tried this with a little dog.
0	the product description should note that only six packages are included for this price , not an entire case ( which would be 12 packs ) .
0	this is not orange and tangerine juice ; it &apos;s mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. and i really don &apos;t care about the vitamin c content ; vitamin c is easy to get. what i do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that i have ever tried. i couldn &apos;t pour it down the drain fast enough.
1	this dog food satisfies both of my dogs and they have had no digestion problems or skin issues , as they have had with other brands. they both have maintained healthy weights and glossy coats on this food. i have been very pleased with the automated delivery service.
1	this is ridiculous. the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted. it is pricey , but wow .. love this stuff. it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup. yummy !
1	i have been ordering koeze nuts over 20 years now. the quality is as good now as they were when i was given my first jar. i gave these to my son in law the first christmas we spent together and when he opened them his comment was &quot; these are wallhangers &quot; . they really are the best nuts i &apos;ve ever had. enjoy ! ! !
0	i tried it , but i just didn &apos;t like it. not a good tasting sugar substitute in my opinion. i &apos;d rather do without sugar than use this again.
1	we tried these chips because dr. oz had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative. my whole family loves them , we have not found a flavor that we don &apos;t like. these are way better than any baked style chip. try them and you won &apos;t be disappointed !
1	the produce was extremely fresh. i made a delicious thai soup with the items and had plenty to spare.
1	i love the fact that there is turkey being offered. this is my son &apos;s 2nd favorite dish. no issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
1	i have a dog with severe allergies we have been fighting for years. the vets always recommend mass produced allergy formulas like science diet. i can &apos;t stomach feeding my dog that type of garbage. but simple is a good alternative , made with quality ingredients and the dogs love it too. great product ! !
1	you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls ! the regular chocolate ones are good , but these are the best ever ! !
1	i luv me some popchips ! ! these are great snack items. i ordered a case , and passed them around my office. now everyone is addicted to these chips. i have not found anyone that did not like these chips ... and they are healthier than the baked chips out there. yumm ! !
0	i bought this product not that many months ago and loved it but no longer buying this brand because it doubled in price ! i bought it for $ 10 originally. will buy another brand.
1	this is my third wine kit and it &apos;s going so fast i should order another. we took samples from all three kits to a thanksgiving get-together. more than once , i heard , &quot; who &apos;s going to finish off this bottle so we can open another pear ? &quot;
1	my family was lucky enough to get this product several years ago from a friend. my daughter will not eat any other pancake mix and everyone i fix them for thinks they are outstanding.
1	crisp / crunchy and thin- very low in sodium. i usually prefer mine plain but shared a package with a friend who enjoyed these with a tuna salad topping. a great alternative to the expensive styrofoam varieties sold at most stores. excellent product. the rice cakes for this brand are also wonderful and for those on a no salt diet , 0 % sodium.
1	great product. recommended by dr. oz. we love pasta but not the calories. this is much better than whole wheat.
1	love to order my coffee on amazon. easy and shows up quickly. this k cup is great coffee. dcaf is very good as well
0	i ordered smoke paprika , unfortunately i received regular sweet. i called and spoke with a gentleman , who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. until today ( 1 month maybe 2 later ) still haven &apos;t received anything or heard from the company. very disappointed.
1	the smokehouse jerky is some of the best out there , a perfect quick snack. it has s great smoke flavor and texture. i even started a subscription to get it once a month .... save 15 % by doing it. the only con would be a little on the salty side. if you like jerky you can &apos;t go wrong with this.
1	i have a 10 year old aussie shep / heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- i tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped. other organic dog food also make him itch miserably. but on the newman &apos;s own he &apos;s stopped the itching and shedding , and he absolutely devours this stuff. love it ! ! ! !
1	we do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. we don &apos;t want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. other energy products don &apos;t taste as good as these do. they are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. good stuff !
1	this salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty. it enhances the salad as it &apos;s not too over-powering. it &apos;s a salty , mildly seasoned packet of goodness. it &apos;s also very addictive probably due to the msg. add olive oil and red wine vinegar , mmmmmm. i can &apos;t believe i found it here , b / c you cannot find it in mainstream supermarkets nor ethnic markets anymore.
1	i love asian flavor w / o the extreme heat. i had this sauce w / some wings at mellow mushroom in knoxville , tn. i immediately asked the bartender if he could find out the brand of the sauce for me because it was perfect. amazing flavor ! ! !
0	the seeds sprout well , it is true , but there is a bitter taste to this mixture. i use them on sandwiches and i thought there was something wrong with the non-fat mayo. plain alfalfa sprouts taste much better.
1	love this sugar. it tastes so much better and isn &apos;t as overly sweet tasting as &quot; regular &quot; sugar. we &apos;ve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff.
0	i meant to order anthony berg &apos;s chocolates and got this one by mistake ... yikes , not a good outcome. the chocolate is poor and the gel-like liquor is worse ... don &apos;t make the mistake that i made ...
1	i &apos;ve tried a handful of other brands of french roast and i find this one and tully &apos;s version to be both great and comparable in flavor. the difference is the price ( this one is far more reasonable ) .
1	great price , the best maxwell house makes. it is a very good coffee for the price , less then $ 3.50 a can.
0	i bought this thinking that i could save money. the taste is very poor and really doesn &apos;t taste good at all. i used it about 5 times and will throw it out as soon as i go to the grocery store again to buy another brand.
0	just be aware ..... the first ingredient on the list is salt. i don &apos;t find this product very peppery , hot or spicy. it is a disappointment.
0	this is potentially the weakest tasting coffee on the market for keurig machine. if you like weak tea then this coffee might just be what you are looking for. i have now brewed 6 cups and all have been consistently weak even in the smallest cup setting. not to my liking
0	it does cause you to have more bowel movements. but causes stomach cramps after 7 days and blood in stool. do not recommend you drink this more than few days. anybody want to buy some sealed boxes , only used the first one ?
1	i &apos;m a big black tea drinker and have tried a lot of different brands out there , and i find that pg makes the best black tea. it &apos;s nice and strong , not like crappy lipton black tea. we &apos;ve been loyal to the pg brand black tea for over a year now - it &apos;s a little pricier than other brands , but definitely worth it if you enjoy black tea.
1	this is great ! organic baby food options - delivered to my doorstep ! the dinners are a good combination and receive a raving review from the bib wearer at the dinner table.
0	licorice has no flavor very hard to eat it was in a seal bag but it hard not soft like other licorice
1	this mix makes a gravy that taste like your good ole southern grandmother made the gravy. no more lumps and everyone thinks you made it from scratch. if you are thinking about it you have to try this. it is the best thing since the invetion of peanut butter
1	great product at a reasonable price .... my husband &apos;s favorite ! loves the dark chocolate although we get the pack of 3 that includes light , dark and peppermint also. shopped around and this is a bargain and surpasses the other cocoa k-cups we have tried in taste.
1	all of the roland products are top quality. roland &apos;s caviar is the real deal , unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed !
0	this is a great product , but it and others like it ( starbucks doubleshot energy drinks , monster java etc ) are more than twice the price of supermarket retail and don &apos;t include shipping. what the heck is going on ?
1	this tea actually tastes the way a rose smells. it &apos;s like sipping on roses when you drink it. i &apos;m glad it can be purchased on amazon because i looked in every regular food store as well as the more unusual stores , like trader joes , that carry unusual food items and could not find it.
0	at sam &apos;s stores you can buy the 175 count for $ 12.98. my restaurant customers love these with their guest checks ! guess i am taking a trip to sam &apos;s. sorry amazon. i will remain loyal and use you for all your other great deals though.
1	this is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating. it has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection. there is a surprising amount of salt in the collection. in other words , each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker.
1	was very happy that the kids liked these ! we all liked them ! i bought this mostly for myself. i made them with coconut oil instead of the vegetable oil that it calls for ..... it was a yummy , healthy substitute. will definitely be buying again.
1	great , fresh coffee beans. gave as a christmas gift. we all had some of it and loved it. the smell was great and the flavour was awsome.
1	tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market ! these r not too salty or greasy. great crispy crunch. plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of. every bag ( after bag ) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st ! !
0	i used to order this product at 25 per box of 12 cans and now it turned into 50 dollars ? ? ? how did it double out of nowhere ? ?
1	ok. if you don &apos;t want to get addicted , don &apos;t try plocky &apos;s red beans and rice tortilla chips ! my husband and i started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. now , we &apos;ve just received our second case. it won &apos;t last long. beware.
1	one of the richer coffee for k cups ! we typically grind our own even for the keurig but the mahagoney from caribou is a great alternative. order was shipped very quickly. will definitely buy again.
0	if you like strong coffee , as i do this coffee is over rated. i found it weak , with a sickening after taste.
0	i have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. i do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. dha from fish oil is fine , but the lady that answered my phone told me that all dha gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. do infants need gelatin at this age ?
0	my grandkids and i love the mints in the tin and thought we would try these to cut down on packaging. they taste terrible. they have a funny after taste and really don &apos;t taste like cinnamon. we won &apos;t buy them again. we buy many newman &apos;s own products , but are disappointed this time. if they aren &apos;t the same mints , they should have a different name.
0	the popcorn pops great but after eating a few mouth fulls , my mouth started burning. it far too salty. my wife refuses to eat it. i will not recommend.
0	i thought this coffee was really horrible. had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can &apos;t be returned.
1	great coffee. rich , robust. a coffee-lovers choice. if you like french roast or italian roast , you will like this coffee.
0	the product image is misleading. the image has the tomatoes as d.o.p. certified , but the tomatoes i received are not ....
0	although the coffee had no reached the expiration date , i felt this coffee was borderline stale. i &apos;m not sure how far out these products are packed to the expiration date , but wished it would have been fresher. as these little packets are somewhat expensive , i was hoping for more.
1	purchased this as a gift for my mother when it was a lightning deal. she was very happy and loved the basket. she enjoyed the cookies and the flavors of tea that were included. shipped quick and arrived when expected.
1	universally popular with all dogs and is the only treat my pets will eat. great that it is all natural.
0	the ad plainly says 16oz can &quot; pack of 3 &quot; . i ordered &quot; 2 &quot; , so that should have been 6 cans ...... i only received two ! i have thought about calling the better business bureau and complaining. it &apos;s a matter of principle ! it is a good mix , but i won &apos;t be ordering from them again.
1	this product is excellent for the group of people who have celiac disease. a tasty treat for sunday brunch. the only problem i have , is the cost , but as we all know , being saddled with celiac disease is not cheap.
0	makes great coffee for about 4 months. cheaply made product. all pipes inside are cheap plastic. even a $ 25 mr coffee has copper water pipes in it to carry the 190 degree water but not keurig .... all plastic water lines. heat plugs the lines up in 3 to 4 months. piece of cheap junk made to look pretty. save your money
1	my shepherd / collie mix has ibs. our vet recommended a limited ingredient food. this has really helped her symptoms and she likes it. i will always buy it from amazon ... it &apos;s $ 10 cheaper and free shipping !
0	when i received this product it was old and dried out ! dingo makes a good product. i buy them all the time and my dog loves them but this supplier should pay more attention to what they ship.
0	half way through the supply , i noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so i checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms. please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog. this may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness.
1	these chips are a great snack if you don &apos;t want all the junk assiciated with chips. try them you &apos;ll like them.
1	i &apos;ve used maybe half a dozen bags of this tea in the last year and it is a delicious , consistently good quality black tea. mainly i use it and several other numi teas in my tea blends for making kombucha.
1	i ordered these candies for the first time and i am hooked , they just have a hint of rose the flavor is not overwhelming. i really enjoy them. highly recommended ! unique candy !
0	i bought this tea as i like blueberries , and stash is known as making good teas. however , when i first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green ( not very appetizing ) . once i mixed the powder with water , the resulting tea had no real flavor. i feel like i wasted my money and can &apos;t get a refund.
0	the flavor of the old beer nuts is almost entirely gone. the beer nuts are now just plain spanish peanuts with a slight flavor , hardly noticeable. extremely disappointing.
0	i got coffee grounds in my cup 4 out of the 5 times i used these. very disappointed because i would like to use my coffee. the hole punctured in the bottom is larger than the one punched out with the regular k-cups , probably due to the design on the bottom of the cup. i have to flush the system each time i have used this product , wasting time and water.
0	omg ..... this is just bad bad bad ..... i could not eat this if i was starving ! i took one bite .... my husband took one bite and the box went right into the trash can.
1	i am addicted to these cookies. they taste much better than the regular ones. the only draw back is , that they should be available in smaller packages - to avoid binge eating.
1	i have several of these converters in my home studio -- the quality is amazing on both dynamics and condenser mics ! i had an icicle that initially had a low hum , contacted blue , and they said that the first 500 units produced had a low hum but that has since been fixed. they sent me a replacement unit and it works perfectly now. buy this product if you have the need.
0	just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine. its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue. had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made. they would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere !
0	if you have a costco card buy it there , this is a ripoff. at costco you get three 1 / 2 gallons for about $ 7-10 , about 1 / 4 of this price for the same amount of beverage.
1	not sure exactly what is in it , but it really helps my sinus condition. a family member who spent time in china said it tasted like other healing herbs she had had while there. the taste is earthy , and takes some getting used to , but it is worth it.
1	great real coconut young coconut taste. not the usual overwhelming sweet taste seen on other coconut water canned drinks. good on the environment. made in brazil. even better. you can really taste the fruit labelled on the product besides the coconut water taste
1	i have been making belgian waffles using the stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix for over three years. my waffles are undoubtedly the best ever ! ! ! i like my waffles light and crisp - i can &apos;t stand a heavy soggy waffle. these just melt in your mouth. i have made homemade waffles , but i have yet to find anything that can compare to this mix.
0	second ingredient is sugar ! need i say more ? make your own bisquit mix , it &apos;s super easy !
1	if you are on the paleo / caveman / primal / hunter-gatherer diet , you will adore these cookies ! otherwise stay away , your taste buds aren &apos;t attuned to the uniquely sweet natural cookies. end of story paleo purchase , sad ( standard american diet ) skip it
0	and the expiration date on top of the can says jan.06,05. i cannot even return it since it is a grocery. amazon , are you serious ?
1	this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice , but it is good. it has a slightly odd flavor , perhaps from a preservative. sure wish i could order the frozen juice !
1	this is one of the best decaf coffee &apos;s i have ever had. i was ordering this product from another website but found that amazon &apos;s subscribe and safe plan is the most economical. great product.
0	amazon doesn &apos;t accept returns of food items , so i &apos;m using this product as dog treats. very expensive dog treats. enough said. : - (
0	picked up a few jars of this on closeout at walmart for a buck apiece. i love all of the pace salsas so i figured this would be good as well. i was wrong. disgusting texture , way too much salt , stale flavor. guess i &apos;ll go back to tostito &apos;s brand , which is not very good but a lot better than than pace.
0	after reading all the good reviews on these chips i have to admit i was disappointed. perhaps i just ended up with a bad batch , but i could barely taste the vinegar and there seemed to be far too many burnt ( and i mean black ) chips in these bags. hopefully the other flavors are better , but i &apos;m going to stick with other brands from now on.
0	i ordered this by mistake and almost mistakenly wrote a good review. there is nothing wrong with the syrup but the bottle looks a lot like sugar free hazelnut syrup and i purchased this by mistake. i &apos;m sure this is good - i gave my bottles away ... i just like sugar free version.
1	i started using celsius over two year ago. gives just the right boost i needed to exercise in the mornings. no crash or after affects. has a great taste , nothing strong or overwhelming.
0	ok ... but would never buy them again my husband ate some ... i thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call muncho &apos;s ! just not for me !
1	they are just the right size , the filter works fine and so does the lid. they &apos;re easy to fill and store for future use. since its &quot; all-in-one &quot; and disposable like the pre-filled keurig cups , its a good way to enjoy my favorite brand of coffee.
0	they arrived on time but dont quite melt as advertised required much stiring and left something of a sludge at the bottom of the cup
0	i ordered the flavor variety pack with caramel , blueberry , etc. i got something with dark magic , french roast breakfast blends , etc. if i had wanted this pack i would have went to costco and spent less for more. beware of what they send. it isnt what they advertised.
0	my finicky cats wouldn &apos;t eat this food so i gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn &apos;t go to waste ...
0	i considered buying these but the health risks should be considered. these are cured , stored with salt , and have nitrates. if you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns. you can still eat well when avoiding such things.
0	very dissappointed to find out i only get 1 box of 24 kcups. almost $ 1 a cup. i usually get 2 boxes for this price. crazy ! ! ! i buy these online because they are much cheaper than stores. i did not receive the right flavor and shipping seemed to take very long. not happy ! ! !
1	this is really a great product. works and tastes just like the gluten product. our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products. we rate this &quot; crossover &quot; brand one of the best.
0	instead of a black graduation cap , a top hat was sent instead. not great for a graduation gift ! also , i think any buyer should be aware that by &quot; godiva 4 pack &quot; , they mean &quot; 4 pieces of candy &quot; ! very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy ! definitely not worth the price ! !
1	these olives are delicious ! they are not overwhelmingly spicy. my 8 year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack. they are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful. the bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag. the calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only 100.
0	i would not purchase this item again. it has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. no listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and i doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. packages are marked &apos; product of china &apos; . i have had no problem with lee kum kee sauces that i purchased in the past.
1	salt &amp; vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so i think i &apos;ve tried every brand out there. these are by far the best. i also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy. they seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
1	my dog likes the iams savory sauce. it helps to tempt him to eat when his appetite is off , and it &apos;s good for him.
1	these are by far my favorite chips , they are extremely crunchy ( similar to other kettle style chips ) , but it &apos;s the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks. i &apos;ve tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close.
1	the natural balance alpha grain-free trout , salmon meal and whitefish formula is working very good for my dog. there is no digestive problems. it also keeps the fur shinny. be sure to provide a lot of water for the dog as he always drinks a lot an hour or two after the meals.
0	there is bpa in the lids and company claims it doesn &apos;t touch the food so it &apos;s okey. why do they even write organic 6 times around the lid ? not honest to their costumer. i wouldn &apos;t even give 1 star if l could.
1	this is definitely a &quot; girl &apos;s alcoholic slushy. &quot; there are 6 different flavors , and you can use any wine you choose. the package directions are for an entire blender of slush. i have found that using a tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person. good stuff. have not found anyone who does not like this product.
1	these things are addicting and low in calories and fat too. i love the wasabi flavor.
1	great candy as always from werther &apos;s original candy , hard or chewy caramels are but two of the candy they make that is outstanding. it seems that you can not keep it in stock and are always out or just have a bag or two left to sale.
0	i used to eat this almost every morning. now it says new great taste but its horrible not even extra brown sugar helps. change it back please ! ! !
1	mae ploy sweet chili sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table. it has just the right blend of sweet and heat ; mae ploy enhances the taste of all meat and fish foods. catsup is almost a condiment of the past. salsa and mae ploy are the answers !
0	i &apos;m jealous of whoever thought of this , but the actual product turns out to be pretty unimpressive. it turns out , if you eat half a fruit roll-up , then eat asparagus , the aspragus tastes differently than you might expect. there. that &apos;s all you need to know. don &apos;t buy this product , just buy some gushers next time you &apos;re at wal-mart. 2 star review because i like gushers.
0	initially , i was not happy with this product. after contacting the vendor they remedied the problem and i am happy with it now.
1	i really like this product and taste great with the coffee or tea , and i have lost weight by cutting the sugar and replacing it with the honey and agave nectar.
1	the olive juice i purchased was not only inexpensive , but has a great flavor. i have looked for a long time to buy olive juice for martinis , but i could not find anyone that carried it. thanks amazon.
0	the dagoba dark chocolate bar did not taste good. they taste like artificial chocolate. i had to throw them away. learn and live.
1	i ordered the mahogany caribou coffee k-cups and adore them. i recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste.
0	dogs loved it but , 3 out of 3 i purchased had the lids crack and break in a number of weeks. they need to use a different plastic.
1	i bought this mostly because i wanted the peppermint hot cocoa , but i fell in love with the milk chocolate one. the peppermint was pretty good as well ... good cocoa ! ! !
1	my grandson and husband love to bond drinking this hot chocolate together. i get it every other month. i can &apos;t ever be without it.
0	after doing numerous googles looking for chipsters , one of my favorite childhood snacks , some reported that this product was very close to them. i disagree. about the closest flavor to the chipsters so far would be munchos , but still not the same. if you are conscious of diet , these will probably due.
1	works well. it is slightly lighter than expected , but the quality of the sound is excellent.
1	it &apos;s basically carbonated fruit juice , but it &apos;s heavier on the juice than a similar drink like rw knudsen &apos;s ( the latter seems to never hit the spot ) . this drink is a great balance of fresh fruit taste , the right amount of bubbles and something like &quot; zing &quot; . very refreshing and tasty. highly recommended.
1	la tourangelle makes some really good oils. i like this company alot ... try the sesame oil too.
1	love it , love it , love it ! both me and my 10 year old drink this herbal tea quite often. very tasty !
1	of all the 100-calorie pack snack products i &apos;ve tried ( and there have been many ! ) these are my absolute favorites. the funny thing is that i don &apos;t even like oreos , and am not that crazy about chocolate. however , these thin crisps are exactly that , thin and crisp. they are also just right to fend off sweet cravings or premature hunger.
1	i love this licorice and as someone with a lot of food allergies , i appreciate that it only has four ingredients.
1	when you have health issues taking gluten out of your diet is a good way to start , it may be the source of your problem , it has been in my case , and using pamela &apos;s products has helped me get on the right track to feeling better.
1	i &apos;ve had many hot cocoa k-cups and i must say this one is the best by far. the green mountain one has a half &amp; half bitter aftertaste while the grove square is very pleasant and is as close as you can get without actually using milk.
1	i &apos;ve tried wrigley &apos;s apple pie flavor of their dessert delights chewing gum. it tastes exactly like apple pie. i can &apos;t wait to try the key lime pie flavor ! everyone who has posted a review here on amazon says it tastes exactly like key lime pie ! wrigley chewing gum co. appears to have hit yet another one out of the ball park ! john v karavitis , john karavitis , karavitis
1	this is a really good product. i had a little trouble the first couple times because i didnt tighten the lid down but besides that it is a good item.
1	i was so excited to see gluten-free bisquick. my grandmother and mother both used it. i fondly remember their strawberry shortcake , so that was the first thing i made. i almost cried , it was so good. i have since made the pancakes ( yum yum ) and baked chicken. i &apos;m a regular at their web site , liveglutenfreely.com for its great recipes. thank you , bisquick !
1	i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting , they make a great snack when i &apos;m on the go. chocolate , peanuts and raisins ... it doesn &apos;t get any better.
1	i know i cannot make tea this good. granted , i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet. it tastes crisp.
1	this goes down in my self proclaimed condiment queen nation as a &quot; keeper &quot; i saw it in the asian market i go to for 2.50 , a huge bottle , i looked at the ingredients , no preservatives or added colors , good , good , said it went with everything , also good , got it home and wow , its amazing ! garlic , hot , sweet , i am a dippin fool now.
0	very expensive and not worth the price. try purityfarm organic ghee , it &apos;s much cheaper and taste much better than this ghee. don &apos;t waste your money.
1	our baby loves it. and amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal. thanks amazon.
0	you can get the 80-count box at costco for $ 35 ! ! ! these prices stink.
1	excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks excellent shipment and product as well , looking forward to purchase again , thanks
0	this was just okay. there are better choices like the black bean or split pea
1	organic foods of course are best for your health and starting your baby on foods that are pure is best no matter what. i highly recommend earth &apos;s best products. he loves the formula , foods and diapers. i love the products because it &apos;s best for my baby. i wish i knew about organics and earth &apos;s best 16 years ago with my first baby.
1	rosamonte especial can never let you down. tastes fresh and strong. i smell argentina in every sip. yerba mate is going through an increase in prices , almost double .. crazy. but it &apos;s worth the value. i will never change rosamonte especial !
1	my finicky calico just loves this food. one of the few wet foods she will actually eat. it is loved by our other three cats as well. will definitely be buying this again.
1	taste great , once in awhile you will come across a pocket of fat but its worth the risk. anything from this supplier is good quality and value.
1	my family absolutely loves this pancake and waffle mix. the texture and taste is the best out there , especially when using our waffle maker. you can add fruit and other items to the mix and be as creative as you wish. your price is great and delivery can &apos;t be beat. we recommend it to everyone ! !
0	was led to believe that this product was individual tea bags not loose tea which requires special brewing equipment and now i &apos;m stuck with product i can &apos;t move. chef joseph
1	everything that is stated in the information is exactly what i had recieved. thank you
0	i was expecting these cookies were going to be normal size but i was wrong ! i was planning on dipping them in chocolates but they r not those average size at all ! so disappointed ! i now have to go out n find the normal size cookies. what a waste of money. i also needed 50 but 20 of them were broken. they do not put fragile on the box outside.
0	i stopped buying these when i noticed they now contain &quot; pgpr &quot; . ( google it ) i now buy only pearson &apos;s mint patties.
1	i purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present , she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time , i didn &apos;t realize it was so hard to find ! she absolutely loves it , made a great surprise christmas gift.
1	my daughter loves painting this stuff on cake pops. it add just a little color if painted on dry but the color is more vibrant if mixed with extract and painted on.
1	smells great , looks great and tastes great. as a guy who likes strong espresso type coffee , i was surprised and impressed by the bold flavor with just a hint of hazelnut. with just a little half and half its great first thing in the morning.
0	these were fair. i don &apos;t feel they are aa quality. would not repurchase.
0	i am always looking for good tasting vegan products. although i enjoy other dr. mcdougall soups , i didn &apos;t care much for the white bean &amp; pasta soup. i would not buy it again.
1	i have a free sampling of these chips and i can see me swapping them for my regular chip cravings. they remind me of munchos , but are less greasy. try them.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001ell9x6 &quot; &gt; numi organic tea chinese breakfast yunnan black tea , loose leaf , 16 oz bag ( pack of 2 ) &lt; / a &gt; i brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half-gallon with this tea. excellent. the resealable bags work well , and unopened they protect my large stash , making it easier to manage my subscription.
1	works wonderfully for most all applications in the garden. could not be easier since it is systemic and helps fertilize only what you want to fertilize.
0	the only way we could make switch orange-tangerine drinkable was mixing 50 / 50 with club soda. it was just way too sweet. it then tasted good , but orangina and san pelligrino both have awesome orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix ! and surprisingly , imported san pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger ( 11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz ) .
0	i bought this extract to use in a pumpkin beer , but i would have ruined the batch. this stuff is gross !
1	this is quick , easy and portable , and i think it tastes great ! it &apos;s my favorite flavor.
1	these mints are really strong and have a great taste. they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse.
1	these are always delicious &amp; a much healthier alternative to most candies / kid &apos;s sugary snacks. the size is perfect for goodie bags &amp; even fits in large easter eggs.
1	i loved this . the beans where fresh and the smell heavenly. i most definately would buy this again. the more expensive ones in the supermarket are dry and way over priced. these were very juicy. loved it ! !
0	made in china , does anything else need to be said ? i used to buy them then noticed the label , i will not buy again.
0	i was anticipating a fragrant unprocessed , minimally oxidized tea that is unique to all white teas. this tea could not be farther from that description. heavily oxidized with a very strong smoky flavor. not even palatable on a second flush. please save your money and consider paying a few more dollars from a supplier such as rishi or specialteas
1	great product and it tastes great. i keep a bag in my drawer at work in case i get hungry and its great to eat to keep my protein count high since i &apos;m working out.
0	it &apos;s a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies ! i &apos;m very disappointed when i noticed that. the same kind sold in china is even better.
0	as coffee , these kcups are just ok. as &quot; flavored &quot; coffee these are disappointing. i found the vanilla to be barely detectable.
0	received product , which i purchased from amazon. not a single cookie survived transit. nothing but crumbs. simply not worth getting from amazon unless they do a better shipping job. i would stay away from anything that is fragile at least in the sense of foods and groceries.
1	this is very good but i prefer the liquid cherry juice. less messy to deal with and the concentrate doesn &apos;t seem to go as far as the liquid juice. just my preference.
1	i bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they &apos;re hard to find. i kept half for myself. i admit , gone in no time.
0	i hate chocolate , but love white chocolate. imagine how pissed i was to open and find normal chocolate brown color and flavor inside. no white chocolate except a teeny tiny thin layer on the outside. doesn &apos;t look a bit like the pic. either. yuck and yuck again ! ! ! !
1	i try to be good , but when i feel like indulging in some delicious , gourmet potato chips , these new york chedder potato chips are the first flavor i like to go for , when i see them at the natural food store. the chips are tangy and crunchy and satisfy your potato chip fix like no other brand.
1	i loved this product , and it was better than what i thought it was going to be. my favorite was teh salt and vinger flavor ( yum yum ) but i hated the cheddar , and salt &amp; pepper ones.
1	get it , get it , get it ! this popcorn is truly the most tender , delicious popcorn i have ever tasted.
1	delicious cookies. i actually thought i was ordering the white chocolate chunk cookies , not the chewy , but definitely enjoyed these. the only down side , is these seem awfully small.
1	i discovered these when i moved to canada a few years back. before this i had only experienced a thicker wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first. the feelings dissolved the first time i ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese. they are a little more &quot; powdery &quot; than i &apos;d like , but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them.
1	red mill &apos;s pumkin seeds are simply the best ! other seeds or &quot; pepitas &quot; don &apos;t come even close. red mill &apos;s seeds are crunchy and very tasty. they are product of the u.s. , not china like most pepitas. well worth the price !
0	some of the best rice milk on the market. it &apos;s just too bad this is double the price you &apos;ll pay for it in the store.
1	this is excellent hot chocolate for those of you that love love hot chocolate- go for it - you will love it to ... i would purchase this again.
1	i &apos;ve used this bbq sauce before and it is good especially considering that is free of so many negatives ( like corn syrup and for us gluten ) but the price on this can &apos;t be right. order directly from the daddy sam &apos;s website to pay $ 5.50 / 19 oz bottle. this price would have to be a case price although the description says 19oz.
1	i love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them. this fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best. overall a great product high quality ingredients and they don &apos;t taste half bad , i of course had to try them if my boys loved them.
0	i bought this to keep my japanese spitz occupied , no good. i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s too difficult for her or if she &apos;s just not interested in working that hard for food. she &apos;s good for a few minutes then gives up even though she &apos;ll get food from it.
0	tastes awful only provides about 10 % of some vitamins 63 calories deceptive nutrition label &#91; bottle contains &quot; 1.25 servings &quot; give me a break &#93; wle.
0	i would like to try this , however i do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of , did i miss something ? they only say what it is not ! would really like to know.
1	i love these chips ! they always make a great healthy snack when i &apos;m stuck at work with just the vending machine for sustenance.
1	i have tried a couple of different cocao powders but this one is a step above the other ones. the richness of the bean has a dark smooth flavor within the powder. it is just a better product
0	had high hopes for this coffee , as a reviewer stated that it had a natural coconut favor. it is dreadful. the product smells like coconut , but has an awful chemical taste. it has a hideous flavor coupled with sickening vanilla background taste. to top things off , it leaves a bitter after taste in your mouth. this product is not drinkable.
1	soy milk is scrumptious and this variety has some extra nutrients added. it &apos;s a great , nutritious , high-calcium , no cholesterol product at a great price. buy a case.
0	i ordered three of the trays ( being a date nut ) and found that two were old or stale. i admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package , but still - dried out fruit. ? ! the last tray was fresher , but the experience was soured at that point. i &apos;m disappointed.
0	yeah , nerds have always had a great taste , but i don &apos;t understand why the wonka company continues to use carmine color in their products. carmine color , which is listed in the ingredients above , is made from the ground up bodies of the cochineal insect. so until wonka learns that they don &apos;t need to use ground up bugs to color their candy red , i &apos;m not buying.
1	i have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the penrose sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages. this is the best penrose substitute that i have found.
1	this is going to be short and sweet. my little ( 10 &amp; 13 lbs ) dogs love it , easy to eat small bits , and it &apos;s a high grade food souce for them. what more can i say.
1	it &apos;s gift for my princess.it tastes good and baby love it.packaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely.
1	i ordered this as a christmas present for my daughter and son in law. he tried it the day after christmas and gave it 2 thumbs up.
0	it has big thread and without smell. i don &apos;t believe this is a real saffron. stop buying this fake saffron.
1	i used this for my daughters candy land birthday party and the kids loved them ! they aren &apos;t full size , but they are still sooooo cute ! ! !
1	it was worth the wait--gluten free bisquick is just like the real thing ! ! everything tastes the way you remember it. so make dumplings , pancakes or cheddar biscuits they are all as good as they can be !
1	a fantastic product for pet treats , great smell and has freeze-dried liver treats beat by leaps and bounds. owner of 2 fussy cockers.
1	these cookie bars are great for packing in a lunch or having alone for a snack. try all the flavors for a variety.
0	the bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted. this product is inferior to other brands i have tried.
1	this is an excellent product. we always ran out of olive juice before we ran out of olives when making dirty martinis. now we have a terrific source for great tasting olive juice and our dirty martinis have never been better !
0	this was included in an expensive shoe stretcher package. i finally realized the reason it doesn &apos;t spray is that there is no hole in the cap. i tried to make one but was unsuccessful. i have to pour the liquid into my hand and dump it into my shoe trying to hit the correct spot , or dump it on the outside of the shoe. very annoying.
1	so happy i got this on a subscription. i might even have to increase the frequency that it is delivered. i &apos;ve used it in everything from scrambled eggs to brownies. it &apos;s not mild like olive oil , but it has enhanced the flavor of everything i &apos;ve cooked !
1	i subscribe to several hormel compleats. this is definitely the best flavored dinner i have tried. i am planning to double my subscription.
1	my three little dogs love this food and i love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products.
0	i love chicken teriyaki and sesame chicken heatlhy choice meals , so i figured i would give this a try. big mistake. the rice does cook the be nice and fluffy but the sauce and chicken taste horrible. for one there is not enough chicken in it and the sauce was far to overwhelming. had trouble swallowing it and threw the rest away. yuck ! !
0	although i think it &apos;s good that they came out with low acid coffee for some people that have issues with too much acid in their diet , i really didn &apos;t care for this particular coffee. i drink my coffee black and i &apos;m used to tasting the pure flavor of coffee and i felt that this coffee had a strong burned flavor. not my cup of tea , or should i say coffee.
1	our dog named &quot; big red &quot; loves your liver biscoti and the closest store was 54 miles round trip. i am not too keen on driving that far so i found your mail service on the internet. now our 8 pound poodle gets his treats again !
0	my husband and i were very disappointed in this coffee , very weak , watery cup of coffee. a definite waste of $ 13.00.
1	i love popchips and especially when they are in individual portion sizes and a variety of flavors ... good for you and tastes great and are easy to put in lunches or snacks on the go !
0	i haven &apos;t used the ham base. it is loaded with msg. i did not realize this when i ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item
0	the first shipment of this mix was excellent and we used it all , but the second shipment must have been old because it had a flat , sort of rancid taste. i wound up throwing most of it away , which i can &apos;t afford to do. i love bob red mill products but i think i &apos;ll shop around for it at the local health food store where it will be more likely to be fresh.
1	i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much , i had to come write a review. the packaging is small for convenience , and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape , blue hue , and even more delicious taste in my opinion. i definitely prefer them over the regular-size altoids and will continue purchasing them ! highly recommended !
1	love this with a bag of shrimp 3 / 4 pound , some stir fry veges and a little onion chopped. not too hot but very tasty.
0	i found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. if i cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt , it was ok. would not order this flavor again.
1	we love this medium full-flavored roast. very smooth taste .. no bitter or acidic taste , at all.excellent coffee .. good value : ) also , try timothy &apos;s kona .. very good , also.
1	this item had a great price and tastes great. the only thing that could make this product better is if the little plastic cup was recyclable or compostable.
1	this is a great product and you provided great customer service. thanks so much for the opportunity to purchase this item.
1	i like em but nothing unique about the flavor. basically saves you from having to make them at home ... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
0	they tomatoes are certified san marzano but not dop like the item shows in picture. i called amazon and they sent me another box of 12 for free to fix issue. the new shipment was still certified not dop. so please know this. tomatoes are ok but not the best fyi.
1	my daughter that is 16 and allergic to wheat refuses to follow the diet. until i bought this. now i make her waffles and freeze them every few days. i usually get 7-8 waffles out of a box. they are excellent.
1	my partner is very happy with the tea , and is feeling much better since starting to drink it. she has been drinking it both hot ( normal ) and iced ( chilled ) and likes the refreshing nature of it.
0	while i gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.
1	this mix allowed my little one to have cupcakes at his second birthday party. they turned out great and with some homemade vanilla icing , they were a hit with everyone ! i even used ener g &apos;s egg replacer to replace the multiple eggs the mix calls for. one hint , bake for almost the maximum time on the directions. they come out golden brown and moist.
0	they send me produt mangosteen gold was expire date 5-01-0-2012 lot # 686377 so i did a claim they not care about people
0	i have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product. twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa. the other two times the product worked correctly. i do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems. so i can not recommend this product.
0	this product was very good when i began buying it but lately it is terrible. there is no taste at all. that &apos;s the reason i no longer purchase this item. thank you.
1	i love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak ...
1	i love this bread. i don &apos;t even like the smell of commercial bread ; you can smell the chemicals from miles. i added rosemary , garlic and olive oil to the mix and serve it just out of the machine ; it was a hit with my dinner guests.
0	one star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less ( or different ) picky from ours. see my review of cat-man-doo bonito sprinkles for info on several products i &quot; tested &quot; in search of a flavor / appetite enhancer , including this shrimp version and another f &amp; s tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four.
1	i am very pleased with these. note : they are kosher ( kof k ) pareve ! at 100 calories / bag , they make a delicious snack.
0	i bought this to include in my daughter &apos;s party bag - it worked so well with the circus theme that we had. unfortunately the cracker jacks were stale. when i heard this the first time i thought no way can &apos;t be but then someone else told me the same thing and then i heard it again from someone else. really disappointing. i am so embarrassed.
1	had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs. stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking , too. good product , good value.
0	this was mostly sauce with 5 ravoili in it. i counted them ! i guess i &apos;m luckier than the reviewer who had maggots in theirs though. to top it off i hate the lid system. to hard for me to get the darn lids offs. cut my finger once on the plastic lid. i &apos;ll stick to the canned ravoili. that is good &amp; you get something to eat.
0	overall i was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. they were way to fragile and crumby. there is just too many crumbs in my bed , how am i supposed to sleep like this ?
1	fast , easy and definitely delicious. makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make. good purchase. will continue to order from here. thanx ...
1	i purchased this tea for someone who enjoys trader joe &apos;s white pomegranate tea , and unfortunately it was not a good substitute. though i haven &apos;t tried it myself i was told it had a strong floral taste and aroma which to that particular tea drinker was undesirable. i am rating 4 stars since this is such a subjective judgement , and i have no doubts about this being a high quality product.
0	this was a big disappointment. there was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. the color is green and not very appealing to look at. however it does work as a great antioxidant.
1	this brand is the lowest price i can find in organic dog kibbles. the subscription is convenient. i wish the company makes 50 pound bags.
1	this is a healthy alternative to regular bisquick and works great in any biscuit mix recipe. i will surely buy it again.
1	being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer i am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
1	we use gluten free bisquick to make coated baked chicken , waffles , pancakes , biscuits , chicken pot pie. there are many recipes available to make quick easy meals. we really like it. everyone can eat it instead of just making a gluten free meal for the one person who is gluten free. reasonably priced for gluten free.
1	these are , without question , the best &quot; diet &quot; crackers i &apos;ve ever had. i &apos;ve had them with and without salt and since i usually put peanut butter on them , i didn &apos;t need the salt. these are great for travel , for kids , and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker.
0	when you consider the shipping charges , these items are up to $ 12 a box as compared to $ 2.50 to $ 3.00 a box on sale in retail supermarkets , wal-marts , etc. if you are lucky enought to be located near a hostess outlet store , the same products can be had for 3 boxes for $ 5.00.
0	one perfect box. no rips , tears or gouges. inside the box ? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. every single can ! very disappointed. should i return them all ? is the chowder any good ? was this a joke ? i rate this 1 star ... for the unblemished box.
0	the title says it all ... i didn &apos;t have heartburn with this coffee but i didn &apos;t like the flavor. since coffee flavor is a very personal thing , this shouldn &apos;t stop you from trying it if you need a low acid coffee.
1	i used to eat beer nuts all the time as a kid. sorta like honey roasted peanuts , but more unique flavor. if you never tried &apos;em , if you like honey roasted peanuts , you &apos;ll love these !
1	bought this as a way to take in omega 3 nutrient. the pack of 4 has lasted me almost a year. you have to grind up the seeds and freeze the rest. no complaints ; very reasonable pricing.
1	i bought this tea as an alternative to very pricey teavana black teas. i have a cup every morning , very smooth refreshing tea.
1	it &apos;s very tasty and very easy to make. if you &apos;re in need of a very quick , filling meal and it needs to be gluten free , this works out great. try the thai peanut one , too.
0	i love this brand and my baby loves the oatmeal cereal. but i decided to try the multigrain and never again. my baby hated it &amp; i didn &apos;t blame her because it smelled really stale. try the oatmeal cereal &amp; forget about this one ! ! !
1	i bought these for my mom and she loves it. she mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate. she enjoyed melting pepermint candies in too.
1	the best hot chocolate , by far .. not so easily available in my area. love the mocha &amp; the double chocolate
1	this is a nice , complex spice blend that makes moroccan food , but it can also very easily be used to give body to a quick &quot; i don &apos;t know what to fix for supper &quot; kind of dish. it &apos;s a great emergency item to have in the cupboard !
1	recently diagnosed a gluten-intolerant , i have been looking for products that allow me to resume a semblance of my former life. these snack bars fit the bill. they have the mouth-feel of a traditional snack bar , and a pleasant tart-sweet fruit flavor.
0	the nerds it describes as wonka nerds , apple-watermelon and lemonade-wild cherry are not the ones in the picture. i wanted the ones in the picture witch are wild cherry and watermellon but thats not what these are. the company that is selling them has the name of the product and the pictures mixed up.
1	really good mix. pleasantly surprised to find it includes macadamia nuts. we will enjoy this mix immensely. i am sure we will order it again.
1	kettle chips are thicker and crunchier ( though greasier at times ) than other chips , and the honey dijon flavor is great. they don &apos;t have the overwhelming salty taste some cheaper chips have , and the 2oz size is great for an adult size snack.
1	great for the munchies or when you just need something to snack on. i love popcorn so this was just what the doctor ordered. just perfect for me.
1	i was born in argentina and this is a top of the line dulce de leche , to eat with toasts or as add-on to cakes ( comparable to chimbote ) . note : i noticed that dulce de leche is an acquired taste. so unless you grew up eating it , you may consider dulce de leche to be a little too sweet.
0	very poor quality for the price. there was no flavor to the crabmeat ; way over processed. was very surprised how easily the crabmeat lumps practically disintegrated into flakes when preparing crabcakes. learned my lesson - pay a bit more at the grocery store for quality jumbo lump crab meat.
0	we loved this for our dog , at first. unfortunately after a few uses , his abdomen became distended , he became flatulent ( and very stanky , yes stanky ) , and had loose stools. not exactly something you want in a large dog. peanut butter will be on our shopping list from now on ; it &apos;s cheaper and works so much better.
0	these bars have a core of unappetizing protein goo , covered with a thin sheath of white chocolate analog. it didn &apos;t taste like white chocolate and even my roommate couldn &apos;t stomach these.
0	if you are looking for a sugar high , then these are what you are looking for. too sweet for me and my family , i don &apos;t think we will be ordering these again.
0	i ordered 6 boxes of these crackers. the crackers are very good , however , all of the crackers ( in all 6 boxes ) were nothing but crumbs when i received them !
1	my cat is so picky ! i &apos;ve tried every brand and flavor and this is my cat &apos;s favorite.
0	i have celiac disease , and been on a gf diet for over a year. i have not had problems with any gf foods , but each time i eat a slice of this bread , i get stomach upset. i am not allergic to dairy or eggs. celiacs beware- there is something tainted in this mix.
0	be careful ! i ordered a pack of 6 , my invoice says pack of 6 , but i received only 1 stick.
1	for those with gluten allergies , this is great. the shortcakes , biscuits , pancakes taste much the same as with the regular bisquick. my only problem with it is that it comes in such a small size. would love for them to box it in larger sizes.
1	i was surprised at the size of these potatoes. i have bought them at my local grocery store before and was disappointed that they were so small. these are perfect ! ! tasty , cook just right. love &apos; em ! !
0	it is a good thing the can is so small. the product is several cuts below sunny delight. terrible !
0	while the flavor and quality of this chili is great , the 108-ounce can is mostly liquid. the number of servings is listed as 12 , but the reality is that it will only serve about 5 , unless you add more of your own ingredients as the first reviewer indicated. i won &apos;t be purchasing this again.
1	best dog food on the market today. had numerous ear problems with our cocker spaniel and they have cleared up since taking this food.
0	she liked the food a little at first but didn &apos;t want much to do with it ... the price is very high and not worth it if she &apos;ll only eat a couple of bites. she had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction.
1	these seeds grow very easy , one seed pack grew about 7 little pots. i would grow using a few seeds about every 4-5 days in 2 separate little pots for my cats so they never was without. a great buy.
1	this carrot juice is the best. i &apos;ve tried so many other brands and this is the tastiest. we love the carrot / orange and the super veggie too. it &apos;s healthy and great tasting ... can &apos;t get better then that.
1	very fresh and tasty soft buns that go well with my omaha steak burger patties. they store well.
1	my baby loves rice and lentil and is one of her favorite things to eat. if we are going somewhere i won &apos;t be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.
1	out of all the granola bars that bakery on main makes my 2 year old loves these the most. maybe it &apos;s because she can still get the taste of a peanut butter and jelly sandwhich but in a snack bar : ) we always have to have a box of this flavor in the house.
1	good product. dogs are vary satified with it. would like to have in a larger bag ( 20 lbs. ) , if this could / would be an option.
0	mrs. may &apos;s should inform their customers where exactly their products are made and take a stand. i won &apos;t be buying any more of her products until further notice no matter how yummy they are. do-no-harm and quality-control is a concept not understood in china. totally frightening what they &apos;re getting away with.
1	i got these cocoa cups based on my sister-in-law &apos;s recommendation. it has a great flavor and is inexpensive. quite a good combination. i &apos;ll be ordering more very soon.
1	good flavor , but not real sweet. i add a little stevia for my sweet tooth.
1	order these with the idea in mind of putting them in waffles , pancakes &amp; a cookiie recipe that i had.
1	i am enjoying this coffee but the vanilla is a little overpowering. the strength of the coffee itself is very good. i can use one packet to make 2- 4 oz. cups with the senseo coffee maker so it definitely saves me money. plus , it is just so easy to make coffee and clean up in the morning !
0	this soda just did not appeal to me it had a very different taste than soda , ( that is probably because i have never a kiwi berry soda before ) , and it was really over sugared. the carbanation level of the drink is low. i think i was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with jones soda. this would certainly not be an item i would want to purchase again.
1	chips are not as tangy as i hoped or expected. poore brothers is a better choice for the &quot; hard-core &quot; salt n vinegar fans.
1	exceptionally fresh quality and quantity and shipped much faster than expected. i was able to make great tom yum soup. thank you ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000p151ai &quot; &gt; fresh thai produce kit &lt; / a &gt;
1	this brand always makes good products , since you buy bulk they turn out to be quite cheaper than in the supermarket. very clean flaxseeds. i add it to my smoothies to bath my joints with some natural raw omegas , supposedly they are better if eaten sprouted , though haven &apos;t tried it.
1	this is an excellent product and i use it just like i used to utilize the regular bisquick product.it works well with any recipe that calls for flour and quickening.
1	this salsa was delicious. it was very spicy as i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve guessed , but was also pretty dang tasty. it was a bit sweeter than i prefer my salsa and given the price i don &apos;t think it is something i would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing , you just might end up loving it !
1	this is the best white popcorn yet ! i &apos;ve tried the others sold on amazon &amp; there &apos;s no comparison. it was fluffy &amp; flavorful &amp; almost every kernel popped ! ( how often can you say that ? ) i &apos;ve already ordered more so i won &apos;t run out.
1	one of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. great product to buy.
0	bitter after taste , flavor was very weak , not worth the money i paid at all.
0	these are from china and nowhere as good as those from italy. spend the extra money and get those from italy.
1	i &apos;d never heard of this brand but they were very cheap here on amazon and i was extremely surprised at how good the dark chocolate hot cocoa is. absolutely worth trying , it &apos;s really quite good.
1	i have never used tahini before - and my hummus was good , but always , something was missing ... after i found out of tahini , i ordered it ( and it was shipped extremelly fast ) and used it. the result was amazing ! one spoon into the hummus prepared from one bag ( 1lb beans ) and i had my favorite ready to go !
1	this is my favorite granola bar ! being vegan and gluten-free is difficult when it comes to finding granola bars that meet my needs. this one is absolutely delicious ! i love the ingredients and all the strawberries throughout the whole bar. highly recommend ! ! !
0	it was not specified on this site and i did not know until i received the product. this is something that should be clear on the product page especially since the fda has specifically warned about chicken jerky products for pets that are made in china. i am going to ask for a refund.
0	if you are looking for english muffins - go to the grocery store and buy them. these do not even resemble english muffins and are tasteless. however , if you are on a restricted diet ( wheat flour , soy , dairy , gluten , etc. ) these might be for you - check the list of ingredients. i didn &apos;t care for them at all.
0	i &apos;ve used the product before and love it but there is just one problem .... the order never came and i ordered it a month and half ago. i think i would do better ordering it from some where else. however i gave the product two stars because the product itself is good. it would have been five if i had recieved the product.
1	i love these chips so much ... and i can &apos;t get over how delicious each variety is ! ! the price here is awesome too !
0	the labeling on this product is deceptive , i recently purchased this item in the store thinking when it says pennsylvania dutch and americas favorite mushroom i was buying food produced in the us only to get it home and find it was a product of china. how sad that a company would try to do this.
1	love this sugar. i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. recommend !
1	this variety pack is perfect for when you want something crunchy and salty. the selection of flavors were great choices for me - i liked them all. the portion keeps you from overeating , and they are healthier for you than potato chips , even the baked ones. i recommend these and will be buying them again and again.
1	these crackers rock. wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time.
1	i didn &apos;t buy them here but i did buy them from buford highway farmers market here in atlanta and they are wonderful. they are worth a try. : )
0	this hot chocolate tastes like hot sugar water with a pinch of coco in it. although , even the sugary taste is weak , and tainted by the flavor of the artificial sweetener sucralose. the consistency is watery and bland. this is when i made the 8oz cup as directed by the directions on the box. i do not recommend this product.
1	these are the best crackers i &apos;ve ever eaten. two crackers spread with cheese feel like a meal to my belly. i spread them with aged bleu cheese , omg good ! why have i never tried or even seen these before ?
1	dogs love this product but it ends up too crumbly and hard to give to the dogs. but it is really a great product.
1	what a lovely tea this is ! the rose petals are abundant in the mix , and when you brew a pot of tea and then raise the cup to your lips , the full , sweet scent of roses greets you ! this tea is perfectly blended and balanced ! its color is coppery-golden , very warm and luscious. i just want to drink it every day , for relaxation and sheer enjoyment !
1	fast delivery. product arrived exactly as described. would purchase again from this company.
0	my sweet little persian looks like she is dying. she &apos;s been puking all night because of these treats. how has this item not been recalled ?
1	have drunk this as my &quot; standard brew &quot; for years. however , tastes change , and i &apos;m beginning to sense that it &apos;s a little on the light side for my maturing tastes. nothing wrong with it - it &apos;s better than most restaurant coffees by a wide margin.
0	kids thought it was just &quot; okay &quot; , but i did not like it at all. odd taste. love their white cake / cookie mix. that &apos;s fabulous.
1	these stay together better than round ones , which crumble terribly. they are good alone , or with my favorite artisana raw sesame butter. they are very well packaged which keeps them from getting broken. also , each package i have opened has been fresh. thanks for a great product amazon !
1	i love popchips. they may take some time getting used to if you &apos;re used to the oiliness of potato chips , but they &apos;re only 100 calories per bag. buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag , but you &apos;re sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around !
1	our dog loves this food ! he was having serious gastrointestinal problems that weren &apos;t clearing up -- until we started him on newman &apos;s own. since then , he has been regular , happy , and healthy.
1	i bought this on a whim because i found some jam made by the same company and absolutely loved it. i didn &apos;t expect much more than basic waffle and pancake mix. this is so much better. it &apos;s easy to use and makes moist , fluffy pancakes that are to die for. i am never buying bisquick again.
0	very disappointing. it initially seemed like a good and healthier alternative to rawhide. i am extremely unhappy that this item is made in china ! i never give my pets anything made in china. there is much information out there about pets becoming ill and dying from products made in china.
1	i love that it is mainstream and that it works like bisquick. not all recipes work the same as regular bisquick though .. so i wish they had more recipes available. it does taste more &quot; gluten free &quot; than some other options out there.
1	i have this on auto ship because i use it so much. i have gone to every grocery in az and the cheapest place is amazon ! this is a great product and whatever you make using this flour will taste great. my son has celiac and is allergic to gluten. i have tried every pancake mix and this one is the one i settled for !
0	it has been something i had looked for so long but arrived dry and flavorless ... disappointing quality , was really hoping to have a positive experience.
1	this is an great product. the taste is great , and it works exactly as described. superb natural sleep aid. amazing !
1	it tastes delisious , and works efectively if yo drink it at the rigth time. lean body is the suplement with the best flavor i &apos;ve ever tasted
1	this is definitely the best snack mix i have ever had ! it got me and my buddies through many movie nights while deployed in iraq.
1	i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. i can &apos;t stop eating them ! ! ! it &apos;s crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. just perfect ! ! ! believe me , some chips are so salty , i can &apos;t finish a small bag. but this one ... i just keep on eating !
1	i love this stuff. i put it over chicken and even steaks. it &apos;s very sweet , and just a bit spicy. just a little goes a long way.
1	we ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly ! my husband and i both like taking them to work for lunch. here &apos;s my recipe , so that i get more protein : i slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before i leave home in the morning , then i add the egg to the water before i cook it at lunchtime.
1	we had not been able to find the dark roast yuban in any of the stores recently. when i ordered this they gave me a date of receipt. it actually came two days earlier. my husband was so excited when he saw what i had ordered. thanks for the quick service on a great product.
0	unfortunately my dog doesn &apos;t agree. i have to count these cookies as a loss and reorder &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b003vd8dso &quot; &gt; three dog bakery bitty bites , baked dog treats , assorted flavors , 13 ounces &lt; / a &gt; . i &apos;m only giving it two starts because i like the wholesome ingredients this brand uses.
1	i enjoy the peanut butter cookie crisp , but they are definitely a departure from the originals. still my son loves them so for this reason i still give it four stars.
1	i used this in making a wedding cake for some friends. it tasted awesome mixed into the fodant ! i would purchase other flavorings from this vendor.
0	i bought this after researching the la tourangelle website and reading everything on the amazon page , specifically looking for allergy information. it wasn &apos;t until i actually received my order that i found &quot; may contain trace amounts of tree nuts , sesame seeds and peanuts. &quot; amazon will not accept returns for this product.
0	honestly the first time i tried jamaica me crazy i had to double check to make sure that i didn &apos;t leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. weak coffee , flavor didn &apos;t appeal to me either. might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. wolfgang &apos;s vienna roast was pleasant though.
1	really not much i can say abut this soup mix it taste great to us. we always bought the canned stuff when making pot roasts or whatever. then tried this well we will never go back to canned again. well worth the money will be buying more.
1	i have tried every brand of stevia on the market and this is , hands down , the very best out there. i use nu-naturals nustevia for all sweetening purposes. it can be hard to find even in health food stores and the ones that carry it usually charge a premium. i was delighted to find it on amazon.com for a very reasonable price , even less when obtained through a standing order.
1	stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix is our favorite. consistently excellent with a nice malty flavor. the 33 ounce cans are a good value for the quality. i highly recommend this product.
1	i love sorghum flour. it &apos;s mild in flavor and smell , it &apos;s easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too. it &apos;s one of my favorites along with millet , sweet rice , coconut and almond.
0	i was a little disapointed with this product. i am allergic to dairy and wheat. when i looked at the ingreadents it did say say wheat free , but now where did it say that there may be some dairy. when i got the package it said it may contain dairy.
1	these are more like a cracker - good for a little fill in for between meals.
1	my dog craves these ... one each morning. she &apos;s never had digestive problems with them , unlike the beef rawhide bones which we wont give her. we couldnt find them suddenly in any of the stores and i was soooo delighted amazon had them ! right to my door quick ! thank you amazon !
0	this stuff is ok , not great but not bad. trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. as far as i can tell , and from my research , no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. this stuff is only good for using at olive garden.
1	i just recently bought gluten free bisquick for the first time. it has been wonderful. i have to admit that i am addicted to their pancakes. they are so light and thick and fluffy ( unlike homemade gluten free pancakes ) . they are absolutely delicious !
1	i use this in and on meats , fish , poultry , vegies , all purpose dip et al. it &apos;s cheap and very very special. i gave big bottles to family / friends at xmas years ago and they are all hooked. you won &apos;t be sorry you brought this sauce into your kitchen.
1	i just tried this crackers and am so pleased .. they are very very thin but strong enough to hold a spread. at only 16 calories per large cracker 3x5 inch size , you really can enjoy a nice treat for under 50 calories. a wonderful find for those of us that try to eat healthy and with some control
1	i love popchips. they are delicious and i can &apos;t believe one bag is only 100 calories. the flavors are great although i am not a fan of salt and pepper. i would highy recommend as a way to try the different flavors. i am sure you will love them too.
0	great for eating straight out of the box , not great for recipes requiring melted chocolate. does not melt well , tends to dry out.
0	honestly , i &apos;m not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews. it &apos;s a little weak but mostly just doesn &apos;t have a rich flavor. it is really missing something. i drink coffee black. maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar ? before buying this coffee , i had been drinking starbuck &apos;s french roast and folger &apos;s black silk , both of which taste so much better than this coffee.
1	i &apos;ve been using lourdes chimichurri for years - the stuff is awesome. i use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family &apos;s sandwiches. we &apos;re also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. highly recommend these products if you &apos;re looking for great taste without the preservatives.
1	i don &apos;t ven know why i ordered these , it was just on a whim. but what a surprise when i brewed myself some hot chocolate. the taste was unbelievable , just like homemade. maybe a tad too sweet , but a tiny little bit of instant coffee added to it did the trick. love it.
0	the product arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion. i did not find this product to have the taste or aroma that its name and roast would warrant. i would not likely order this product again.
1	yum ! i could live off of this stuff. the peach flavor is refreshing and delicious. it &apos;s no longer sold where i live , and i really miss it. ( can &apos;t even get it from amazon. ) it &apos;s just too good to be discontinued.
0	i have had organic dried fruit before and could actually chew it. not this though. too hard ...
1	my daughter and i loved these when they first came out but had been unable to find them locally. then i thought , if anyone would have them , amazon would ! so glad to find them - it made a nice addition to her christmas stocking.
1	this was the best pancake / waffle mix ever ! wonderful for breakfast or dinner. it was a great price and worth it ! my husband and boys kept complimenting the waffles i made and ate them fast--i could hardly keep up. definitely recommend stonewall kitchen farmhouse pancake and waffle mix ! you do have to add a few ingredients , but it is well worth the effort.
1	this product works exactly as it is advertised. no more rinsing wire baskets. the coffe is as good as the already filled k cups that you buy in the store. it &apos;s nice to just throw the whole thing in the trash when done and not clog the sink. couldn &apos;t be happier as it gives me unlimited choices for coffee and it saves money too ! amazon is great !
0	the oil tastes like bland olive oil. it has no taste of avocados in salads. too expensive for its poor quality.
1	i just switched from merrick whole earth brand pate style to this upgraded line by merrick and my dog loves it ! this a great for dogs that like &quot; human &quot; food.
0	too much msg gives it a nasty salty after taste. i basically gave them away.
0	when i eat junk food , i &apos;d like to enjoy it , the guilty pleasure it is. these cookies are neither healthy or tasty. stick to chewy chocolate chip cookies.
1	i have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others. when it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down. even without using lagering methods it always develops into a a tasty drink.
1	this tea is so helpful for congestion and it tastes great too. make sure you let it steep as long as the directions say. it really seems to help you to feel better.
0	not hot at all. like the other low star reviewer , i got suckered by seeing &apos; habenero &apos; in the name and the 12 oz size. some people might like the flavor , citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix ( according to the ingredient label ) , but if you &apos;re looking for hot this ain &apos;t it
0	the protein powder is ok , not to good as i expected. if you pour hot milk over it will will form substance like egg white , which is very bad in taste , not at all drinkable.
1	i have been enjoying this product for some time. i buy it at wegmans grocery store , i believe the cost is under $ 4.00 a box. if you like black licorice you will love this product.
0	this did not last 15 seconds with our dog. chewed the piece that inserts into the bottle. do not buy ! ! !
0	i eat mixed nuts all the time at work. they make a healthy snack instead of the donuts , etc. that are always around. the plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. the down side is that they are almost all cashews. very few brazil nuts , pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. the lack of variety is disappointing.
0	this tastes terrible ... like putting aritficial sweetener in already sweet hot chocolate. the best i have tried so far is swiss miss hot chocolate k-cups. don &apos;t think they are sold on amazon yet ...
1	i had a taco party and almsot every single guest asked me how do i make the corncake ? . i run out every year.
0	these cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - i didn &apos;t realize until i tried one , and ended up with a little bit of a headache , which made me check the ingredient list - it isn &apos;t noted on the front of the box. they definitely have an artificial taste , i would not buy them again.
1	great deal and great transaction ! finally , an affordable way to indulge my chocolate craving. will definitely buy this again !
1	this is the best marinade to inject in a fried turkey ever made ! you don &apos;t have to add anything of your own ( maybe a little olive oil , but that &apos;s all ) . plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey , but this marinade can be injected to make a tender , juicy fried turkey. we loved it !
0	bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. not a fan of gummi stuff. so , that was my mistake. but , the strawberry flavor is ok. the bag is gigantic. so it &apos;s good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. they advertise a five pound bag , they &apos;re not kidding.
1	i was very pleased with the price of this product. and the shipping speed was fast ! i like that i didn &apos;t have to lug this back from the grocery store. thanks , amazon !
0	maybe it &apos;s just me , but i have used this extract in my oatmeal ( same amount as mccormick extracts ) and i can &apos;t taste any flavor at all. very disappointing.
0	i though this product lack flavor as i taste different brands far better. there were no real flavor as i expected. sorry
1	these potatoes are really very good. my husband and i both * love * them. and way too easy. we will be buying more of these.
0	i bought this popcorn based on other reviews. the people that wrote the other reviews must work for the popcorn cmpany. the popcorn is not that good and has no butter taste. plus , this makes the popcorn very expensive. i would not buy this popcorn again.
0	i found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste. my previous experience with tarallini was different , they were crunchier and not crumbly. whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe , i don &apos;t know , but i would not buy this product again.
1	this is the second time that i ordered this product and i &apos;ve been very happy with it.
1	i really liked these chips as did my entire family. i wish you could pick and choose the flavors in the variety pack. i would love to try the sweet potato and chili lime and leave the salt and pepper behind.
1	i love these chips. the flavor is not plain. they are sweet and spicy all at the same time. the only drawback is it has a tad bit too much salt. but , it still a great flavor !
1	our four dogs love this stuff ! this bite size treat is a perfect size for training. the dogs like the crunch - it &apos;s shaped like a small square crouton. there is enough in this huge bag to make little gift bags for friends with dogs.
0	as many others have noted , these treats made our dog extremely ill. we could not figure out what was wrong at first. eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. we stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. we threw them out. stay very far away from this product.
1	i got the beans in the prescribed amount of time , and even before i opened the package i knew they were going to be great. the amazing aroma of the beans was evident and only intensified after i actually opened the packaging. i bought them explicitly to make my own vanilla extract , and i have to say they are some juicy beans. i highly recommend them.
1	these potatoes are pretty good. they can be eaten alone or served with a meal. really like potatoes and this is an easy choice.
1	i love to put a bag of pumpkin crunch on the table at work and watch people &apos;s faces light up when they taste them. try it.
1	delicious , light and full of flavor. it &apos;s difficult to decide what my favorite flavor is , but bbq is amazing ! i was impressed with the packaging , but i can &apos;t imagine it is too cost efficient or eco-friendly. that is my only complaint. great product and guilt-free snacking.
1	although there were several &quot; shriveled &quot; ones , they taste just fine. i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don &apos;t have to look perfect anyways. for the price , they are a great deal ( about half of what i find them for in the store )
1	grove square is the best k-cup hot cocoa i &apos;ve tried. and i &apos;ve tried a number of the other brands. this tastes like &quot; real &quot; cocoa used to taste. and if you add a little milk it &apos;s even better. it &apos;s so hot from the keurig that the milk helps cool it down anyway. if your looking for a real chocolate-ly flavor give this a try.
1	somehow i feel healtier eating these things instead of peanuts. i don &apos;t know why either. also , unlike peanuts , i can limit my intake to a handful and not the whole bag.
0	this item molded 7 days after opening ( stored in air tight container ) i would give it -10 if i could , tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni
1	the grove square hot coco k-cups have a good flavor but i find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. thus i recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right.
0	sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. this is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food , and no iodide. the anti-caking agent isn &apos;t event that effective , so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. stay away !
1	we only like white popcorn , and the only grocery store option where we live is jolly time , which is not bad. for fun , we started ordering various white popcorns online , and this is by far the very best white popcorn ! ! wish it were a little less expensive , but we &apos;ve decided that it really is that much better than others. we are now snappy white popcorn snobs ! : )
0	i opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray. chocolate was no better than hershey &apos;s and worst of all , it is imported from hong kong. i don &apos;t care to eat food made in china after all their countless product safety issues. look elsewhere
1	over the past two years , thanks to amazon , i have been sampling jerky from literally all over the u.s. i finally found a tasty , jerky that doesn &apos;t give my jawbone a workout. great meat flavor , an excellent snack.
0	these chips are greasy and taste burnt-there is grease in the bottom of the bag and the chips are saturated with it ( especially at the bottom of the bag. even if they are trans fat free , they need to be a lot less greasy.
1	nice product. good company. only complaint is that it took over a month for them to ship it after i ordered and they never let me know what was going on.
1	these chips are truly amazing. they have it all. they &apos;re light , crisp , great tasting , nice texture , and they &apos;re all natural ... and low in fat and sodium ! need i say more ? i recently bought a bag of them at a regular grocery store , and couldn &apos;t belive my taste buds. that &apos;s why i excited why i saw them here on amazon , and decided to buy a case !
0	received 6 bottles of concentrate from paragon. mixed exactly to their specs. , and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors. i am truly saddened to have to encourage you to not purchase the watermelon flavor. this item has be returned for a refund.
1	we first discovered community coffee while on a visit to lake charles , la. and until recently it was only available in la or by mail. we prefere the hazelnut blend , it has a nice rich flavor without being overly strong. this is very good coffee. we like it and have a standing order with amazon to have it shipped to us at convenient intervals.
0	the title says it. some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted. others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below. it appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here. it was 65f here when the package was delivered.
1	great ! hot chocolate ! by far the best kcup hot chocolate i have found. i use a little milk or half and half and it &apos;s so ..... good. i definitely will order again ! thanks for the super fast shipping !
0	i bought these chips looking at its sale rank as one of the most sold chips on amazon.com. unfortunately , i was highly disappointed. way too much vinegar and they aren &apos;t like regular potato chips , some weird &quot; pops &quot; .
1	about ten years ago my wife and i stayed at a small resort near domenical , costa rica. lizano was on every table in the restaurant. we were quickly hooked. lizano goes great with eggs , beans , rice , tortillas , pork , fish , etc. it &apos;s really tasty and nothing taco sauce or steak sauce. we &apos;re on our second case now. give it a try.
0	the bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1 / 2 loaf. i checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results. after raising the temp to 100 degrees i got it to rise to 3 / 4 loaf. pretty expensive for the quality and i won &apos;t buy again.
0	i know others like salt more than i do but i am not on a salt free diet or anything like that. i love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste.
1	they are raw so i put them on a cookie shhet no spray and dry roast them at 350 for 7 to 9 min. then they have a roasted flavor without any of the oils.cankeep in freezer to keep fresh.very yummy. great on salads.
0	i was disappointed in the quality of this coffee. it has a weird whang to it - a bitter taste. my husband tried it and said the same thing. i don &apos;t know if i got a bad batch or what , but i won &apos;t be using this coffee except for emergency backup ( when i &apos;m out of good coffee ) .
1	i had bought a black and decker one-cup coffee maker that used these pods. it didn &apos;t work properly , but i have managed to use the pods with my old , stand-by coffee maker and am please with the flavor and convenience. someone had commented about a problem with some of the pods being sealed in the outer packaging. i have not encountered that problem. overall , i am pleased with this purchase.
1	i was really impressed with this. there are many flavors , and quite a bit of heat. with this and your favorite brand of cocunut milk you can make some great thai curries at home.
1	very tasty gluten-free option. my kids loved it as it wasn &apos;t too spicy.
0	this was my own fault for not reading the small print but just to save someone else my fate - these are the smallest of boxes not the movie-size boxes ! i can get this product in the movie-size for $ 1.00 locally. this small box cost me almost doouble that. lesson learned.
0	i ordered two boxes of bold roast and instead i received light roast. now i am stuck with what i didn &apos;t want. the bold roast is perfect and it is my favorite coffee. wish there was someone i could complain to about receiving what i did not order.
1	this soup has fantastic flavor. i did not add the canned tomatoes but i did add all the extra vegetables in the my fridge.
1	i love coffee that i buy locally and this product allows me to use it in my keurig brewer. getting the lid on is a little challenging , but the end result is worth it. this is the coolest find of mine this year ! !
0	just the right kind of chips , they are crunchie , light and wonderful. great for people dieting. they are popped , not fried or baked. try them you &apos;ll enjoy them.
1	i run a small bed and breakfast , and bought this product so i could prepare recipes for my guests that have a gluten allergy and they love it. there are many recipes on the box , and even more on their website. quick , easy , inexpensive , what more could anyone ask for.
1	i am very pleased with this dog food. my sheltie has a good coat and good movements with harmony farms. does much better with this food than others. he is a very picky eater , so i do add chicken and he will eat. we will stick with harmony farms. i also like the bag , it helps keep the food fresh.
0	i did not realize until i received this product , that it contains propylene glycol. to be fair to the seller , if you read down the amazon page far enough , that fact is stated. however , i find the thought of ingesting propylene glycol disgusting , so i am going to search for a replacement that is pure natural lavender.
1	these k-cups really save money. i can have the coffee i like and my husband can have his. delivery was quick and product exactly as described. will be buying more !
1	my little guy ate this all up before i could even write a review ! : )
1	i am in love with pop chips ! they are my go to low calorie snack ! the largest 100 calorie pack out there !
1	i used to use this coffee after we visited costa rica and gave some to my aunt. she thinks it is the best coffee there is , so i gave her some for christmas. it is excellent.
0	this &quot; baby white &quot; popcorn pops small and somewhat hard. i have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat , using a &quot; whirlypop &quot; popcorn popper. unsatisfactory results ! i won &apos;t purchase this again.
0	i wish i had bought a single packet before committing to the case. my baby made a horrible face when i gave this to him. my husband and i both tried it and it has a very unpleasant and strong after taste. we opened a few different packets to see if maybe only one was bad. they are all the same. not sure what we will do with the rest of this case.
1	excellent energy drink , i drink one-a-day before i go for my daily walk , gives me a nice boost ! i like the taste , may take a few too get used to it ! no jitters just a boost !
0	i just ordered this product for the first time and i was really bummed when i got it yesterday. 7 cans out of 12 were dented pretty good. amazon was nice and gave me a full refund. really sucks the can were damaged i was looking forward to making some organic pumpkin pie.
0	it sounds delicious , but the taste is just too fruity , and not all that good tasting. it just tastes weird , for lack of a better description. i enjoyed van houtte french vanilla and creme brulee flavors , but this one will be re-gifted : ) i wish you could get smaller samplers without having to commit to this many.
1	most soy sauce is from japan but they are having problems with radiation in their soy bean fields. i am not sure how long the contamination will last. i like the idea this product claims no gmo seeds. yea you pay more but decided not to take a chance on japan.
1	these are the greatest potato snack products i &apos;ve found. only 2 points for weight watchers. really crispy and tasty. all of the flavors are great. my only complaint ...... it &apos;s difficult to open the little bags. i need a pair of scissors , but i guess that keeps them fresher for longer so it &apos;s a great trade off. i would recommend these chips to everyone.
0	these were rancid upon receipt. terrible. very little sugar if any used. something went wrong with these as i can &apos;t believe anyone would see this as a final product. both cans !
1	i bought a box of grove square hot cocoa because i love their cappuccino french vanilla. i used the medium cup setting and added some whipped cream ... it was to die for. very yummy and almost as good as homemade. i never noticed an aftertaste like other reviews , but it could be because of the redi whip i added to it. i highly recommend it.
1	i knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips. the price per bag can &apos;t be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
1	my 3 dogs love this food and are thriving on it. ingredients are high quality and amazon price is better than anywhere i can get it except on sale.
1	this people is a must have especially to take xlr over to usb it provides un interrupted audio flow during recording and provides phantom power. great invention !
1	nuttzo makes great nut butters. their chocolate version is like nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. delicious and super-nutritious.
1	what a steal ! i make a lot of gingerbread cookies during the holidays - large ones - over 6 &quot; long - and i bag them in florist corsage bags. they look like you bought them at a fancy store. these decorations are the best and they are so cheap.
1	excellent for gf. not bad on it &apos;s own but i have used it as a basis for coconut cake , pineapple upside down cake , tres leches cake and others.
0	this food is organic , sure. however , look at the ingredients , top 7 includes chicken meal. never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product. it &apos;s a cheap substitute , and really is bad for the dog. i suggest a brand like evo , blue buffalo , ect. no ingredient should be meal or by product.
0	this was the first time i ordered this brand. all six cans were rancid. i returned them right away and canceled my subscription. you would think baby food products have a better quality control but i guess some companies do not care.
1	it is very very good sweets amazon always is excellent amazon always is excellent amazon always is excellent amazon always is excellent
1	in my office , and for me personally , this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your keurig machine. great price too !
1	i began purchasing this tea years ago and looked forward to it each year. for the past two years i was unable to locate it in my local stores so i was elated to find it at amazon. it tastes like cinnamon and red candy apples to me. i love it !
1	i don &apos;t drink hazelnut coffee , but my wife says this is the best she has ever had and asked me to buy more for her.
0	when cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about 1 : 15 secs in my microwave , wtf ? it has done it to me three times in a row , then i tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem. i &apos;m not sure this stuff is even safe !
1	these soy crisps are very filling and satisfying. if you are looking for something with a great salty crunch , these are for you. they are high in fiber and protein , and that is great if you are trying to watch your calorie intake. i think they are great and recommend them highly.
0	this is a pleasant mint , but if you are used to wintergreen altoids this product will disappoint you.
1	my son really enjoys earth &apos;s best lentil ! he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more. the product shipped very quickly.
1	i just purchased this today for 3.99. i can &apos;t believe this price. the product is wonderful however. nice soda like fizz , but juicy instead of cloyingly sweet.
1	the name of this coffee is mahogany , in my mind a deep rich brown. the coffee flavor is deep and rich , and the color is dark brown. it is delicious.
1	my dog has heart failure and can &apos;t have the standard dog treats because of the salt. these are perfect- she likes to &quot; hunt &quot; for her snacks , and these are perfect to toss out to her , and let her go nuts. she really likes them : )
0	i haven &apos;t purchased this product but wanted to post because it is misleading. cream of tartar is the salt of tartaric acid. cream of tartar is used for baking. if you are trying to make mascarpone cheese you need tartaric acid !
1	awesome tasting nuts ! love them ? will be ordering them again. the entire neighborhood wants to eat them all but i am stingy.
1	the seller was prompt to ship , i receive the disposable k-cup in two days. when i receive them , i try one of the disposable k-cup on keig , the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre-fill k-cup coffee brands is worth the price.
1	i like the smooth taste of this coffee. it is decaf so not too strong but really not very light either. it &apos;s just the light coffee that sometimes needed at mid-day. recommended.
1	vita coco water is taste great by itself or mixed up in a smoothie. it is great for re-hydration after a workout and has more potassium than a banana.
1	better then i expected. i notice there was some complaints that the muffins were dry. so i sprayed the mix before cooking with a butter flavored publix spray which is canola oil. &#91; same as pam butter spray &#93; . this did the trick &amp; they were great
1	i love these potato chip they r soooo good ! = ) sweet and spicy but not overwhelming just enough to work up the palate , not salty just enough to balance out the sweetness i will be ordering these again soon. love it !
0	the smell of this coffee was nasty. i thought maybe the taste will be a little better , wrong ! honestly , do not waste your hard earned money on this one.
0	my cat and my neighbor &apos;s cats would not eat this food. i wound up giving the case to the cat rescue organization.
1	i got this product for my husband beause he loves dr pepper. it came before the date it was suppose to arrive on. he loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt , he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore. the item was packed good and safe and everything was there. no complaints !
0	this was a waste of money ! the plastic rope cracked and broke within a couple of days. our little pup barely touched it.
0	shame on amazon. this product arrived 4 / 18 / 12 with an expiration date of 6 / 12. this product is good for a year , and the one they shipped me expires in a little over a month. i want my money back or a new / fresher product.
1	ive heard mixed reviews of this .. yeah it feels cheap ... but so what ? ! just take care of it like you would anything like that ! and it sounds perfect ! i use it to record vocals on logic studio ( i get others to sing , i cannot ; but they sound amazing ) ive had no problems with it and im super happy with the purchase. well worth the money !
0	this is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe ... it &apos;s artificially flavored , and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. my household hated it. of course , that would be my problem if the description was accurate , but it &apos;s not. amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page.
0	the advertised regular price of $ 99.99 is ridiculous. 5 hour energy drinks are widely available for $ 2.00 each. don &apos;t buy from sellers who inflate prices and charge ridiculous amounts. you can get a case of 12 for $ 20 right here on amazon.
1	best bisquick pancakes i &apos;ve ever made ! i think these are better than the original bisquick pancakes. my husband even loved these ! i would recommend buying this product !
0	both of my dogs had trouble with this formula , allergy wise. it took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food. needless to say i won &apos;t buy this product again.
1	i hate honey but i love bit o honey candy. i really don &apos;t taste the honey in them. i like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat. i like them hard , brittle and chewy , not soft. this is actually cheaper per bar than where i buy them locally.
0	this product sounded great. i ordered a box and really could only eat one. i took the box into work and found that my opinion was shared. they just tasted empty of flavor. very disappointing.
0	after taking a tab , i was able to eat a hot pepper , but it didn &apos;t really taste sweet or good at all , just not very hot. then i tried some cayenne pepper , which remained hot with no alteration in taste.this is a nice idea , but didn &apos;t work for me.
1	so many different flavors to choose from. i ordered this brand for the first time and the taste is wonderful. it was the only decaf french vanilla i could find. i have decided to switch from my old brand to this one.
1	switch is a great alternative to sodas for our family ! love them and i don &apos;t feel bad about the kids drinking them. great variety of flavors ! i just wish they were more easily found in stores.
1	makes a nice lager that &apos;s quite a bit heavier than the domestic lager beers. i don &apos;t plan on making any more , but has more to do with my love of dark ales than the quality / flavor of this kit.
1	this is the best ever. just add hot water and mix. yummy with anything can even add to cream sauces and soups. add some sausage and you are in heaven. yummy yum. cannot go wrong ordering this product.
1	how can you not like this at what great price they sold it at ? i also split it up and sent some to my daughter. it is one of my favorite cooking spices along with oregano , but i tend to make alot of stews and soups. one must have spice is thyme of course. the oregano is for tomato sauce along with basil ... this was a deal.
1	i picked up my first bottle at our local farmers &apos; market. we loved it so much. so flavorful. but sadly , there is no farmers &apos; market in the winter. so glad to see it on amazon.
1	this was sold out at cafe express site. thrilled to find it here. quick delivery and great service ! happy to know that i can find it here.
0	i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ... not gallon size = ( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum &quot; double bubble &quot; i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting ...
1	such an easy way to buy calorie controlled snacks. the arrived quickly. so easy to take to work or when you need just an easy snack.
1	i am so happy to have found a wonderful decaf tea for myself and guests. this tea is nice and full flavored and has a very smooth finish. i usually use the k-cup twice on xl setting and the tea remains true and delicious. the price is the best i have found anywhere
1	we found these pink grapefruit tic tacs while vacationing in massachusettes ; when we returned to california , we couldn &apos;t find them ! i was happy to find them here. they taste great !
1	the jumbo size is great , and makes for easier consuming. those of you ranch heads like me , do yourself a favor and immediately upgrade. this flavor is even better , easily the best david has to offer. great price on amazon , especially since these flavor seeds are pretty hard to find in regular stores.
1	if you are used to eating flaxseed , then this is the brownie for you. hodgson mill brownies are super easy to make , and taste great. since i like dark chocolate , i usually add a little more cocoa.
1	these are tbe best fruit chews i &apos;ve ever had ! the flavor and texture is great. my son had these last summer for the first time when he was at the boy scout ranch , philmont , in new mexico. he , of course , said this as a real treat while he was there. i &apos;m so glad i found them on amazon ! well worth the price ... a great value !
1	the tea tastes great hot or iced. very good for the price. i recieved the package fast with no problems.
1	i have tried to duplicate this without having to buy the prepackaged stuff , but have never come close. the stuff this creates is outstanding in texture and flavor. i have always like the little dollop of corn yumminess that they sell at the tex mex chain chevy &apos;s and this is almost a spot on replication of it. great stuff for even picky eaters like young kids.
1	i really enjoyed these beef sticks. even though i preferred them to be a little bit harder , they were tasty. i just put them in the frig and that worked out fine. nice flavor , not too sweet or spicy. they sure didn &apos;t last in my house !
1	these are fresh , crunchy , natural , and healthy snacks you can reseal and keep in the car , crumble into non-fat yogurt or over salads , or pack some in the kids lunch. convenient and delicious.
1	my dogs loves them. glad to know that i have found a snack that is appealing to my dog but also something that won &apos;t have him breaking the scales !
0	this was a great gift for my son &amp; his wife - they have had many sleepless nights with a new baby. after new years day dinner we brewed one of the blends and had it with pie. the aroma and taste was excellent !
1	i enjoyed the flavor of this orange soda. it was not overly sweet and the orange flavor had just enough tartness to it. i am glad it does not have any hfcs in it , but the calorie count is still quite high from the natural sugars. all in all , if you are looking for a good orange soda , try this one.
1	cheap and works well the only thing is the gain on it is a little low even at highest setting. other than that ir records well and does what it needs to.
1	i hadn &apos;t tried caribou brand k-cups before and am extremely picky. i like a rich , intense , well-bodied coffee and this product delivered. strong but no bitter taste , when brewed with 6 oz. water. i would recommend this product to anyone with similar tastes and will definitely buy it again.
0	i don &apos;t care for bigelow &apos;s version of their spiced chai. they don &apos;t list their ingredients on the box - but this definitely has something strange in it. i bought it because i couldn &apos;t find my regular brand - but i &apos;ll be giving these away. : (
1	grove square hot chocolate is the best k-cup hot chocolate. i read many reviews before making this purchase , and now i agree , and will continue to buy this brand.
1	i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most.
1	wow ! thank you bisquick for coming up with a gluten free product. i tried it and it works wonderfully. so far i have used ot for waffles ( recipe on the box ) which were excellent and a baked chicken and spike recipe which was also wonderful. anyone needing gluten free products will like this.
1	dude , these things are pretty good ... as long as you &apos;re not bent on them being just like oreos. i mean , they &apos;re not. but i definitely like them better than other chocolate cracker snacks like teddy grahams. the lightness of the crackers makes them perfect for slathering on other goodies , like peanut butter , cream cheese , icing , pudding , melted chocolate ...
0	to be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. up all night screaming from gas pains. garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.
0	i found this exact same product , same size at our local grocery store ( qfc and safeway ) for $ 2.99. so , am not sure why this product is priced so much higher.
1	i picked these up for my wife so she could make coffee out of any brand she likes. they work perfectly in her new keurig that i got her for christmas. you couldn &apos;t ask for better.
0	i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens ( dairy , soy , nuts ) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions. unfortunately , these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry. i threw them away. i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free.
1	i eat them just like this ! i like something with substance to it , and when you eat these , you know you &apos;re eating something. they &apos;re healthy , taste good , and are reasonably priced.
1	anytime i have started to get even the slightest sore throat , i drink this and the next morning it &apos;s gone. i always bought it at world market , but they said it has been discontinued. but , thank god for amazon !
1	i had gotten a box of malher hilachas style sauce from my mother and set it aside for a rainy day - well , today it rained. i mixed the package with water , added rice , some peppers , onion , chicken and potatoes and let it simmer. my entire family just loved it - even my picky grandson ! now , i want to find more ! ! ! !
1	the cookies were kind of stail but other than that it was fast shipping and good packing the cookies weren &apos;t broken
1	i am very happy with this tea. i hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags. it is great tasting. i add ginger chips to it and it really is great when i have an upset stomach. i just recently received my second order.
0	this is not jerky , this is processed , hard like a rock , very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can &apos;t break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat ! the dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed , it was hard to chew , and it sounded like they were crunching rocks , where is a zero star button ?
0	there is contradicting information. the description says senior greenie large , while the photo shows &quot; regular &quot; as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce. anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated.
0	i tried several brands and definitely prefer the green mountian brand over van houtte , gloria jeans , or coffee people. i suggest someone new to k cups to get the smallest samples of each brand and decide for yourself before buying any in quantity.
0	this muffin mix is awful , .. all you taste is flour and sour cream , .which is used to make these. it just tastes wierd. i &apos;ve tried and tried , .. there are no good tasting low carb &quot; treats &quot; , .. esp. for diabetics.
1	i thought they were very good chips , delicious ! and as soon as i run out , i &apos;ll be ordering more very soon.
0	dear raisin bran , less raisin , more bran. - sincerely , &quot; someone who had to eat this because she had no better cereal atm. &quot;
0	stale. the worst flavored , worst tasting walnuts that anyone ever tasted. they shouldn &apos;t even be on sale. where is your quality assurance or quality control ? i want my money back.
0	i was told by a professional baker to use powdered food coloring as it was the only way to go when making colored cakes and french macarons. what a disappointment. i ended up adding almost a tablespoon to my french macaron batter and it was such a pale color , that it wasn &apos;t worth adding a whole canister at the price. this isn &apos;t the way to go if you want bright vibrant colors.
1	i recently went gluten free and this is one of my favorite mixes. i used it for biscuits and pancakes and it &apos;s very good. you can also use it for pizza dough and to make fried chicken - it &apos;s about average for that.
0	this was okay , not even hot , tasted kinda like it was old.i was really bummed out. i had high hopes , even though , i ate it anyhow.although the free sample was top shelf , finest of quality , fresh , and definitely executive standard.to me , the habenero flavor was stale tasting , and not worth the money , honest.
1	i finally found a hot cocoa for the keurig that isn &apos;t too sweet. i made a cup the day it came in the mail and from the first sip i was hooked. from now on this will be the only hot cocoa i drink.
0	very dissapointed in shipping. this is the second time i have ordered and all the cans are dented
0	i don &apos;t get all the hype over this coffee. not much of a head on it. doesn &apos;t taste that great. what &apos;s the big whoop ?
1	love this tea ... especially love triangle bags more flavor &amp; the tea is what i remember it to be ... happy came right on time in great shape ... happily enjoying my pg tips ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001eq5jle &quot; &gt; pg tips black tea , pyramid tea bags , 240-count boxes ( pack of 2 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	these sunflowers seeds are of a great quality in every bag and the flavor of the salt &amp; pepper is very bold. i love these and the shipping service from the company has been great every time i have ordered.
0	so bad , i returned it. my children didn &apos;t even like it , and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food.
1	might be a little spicy for some , but this stuff rocks. i use 1 / 2 and1 / 2 with v8 for a milder version , or the best is a bloody caesar ! half mix , half clamato !
1	glad to find this for a birthday present as hard to find decaf ones in store. makes good ice slushy and milk sakes cold. for those who can not take decaf , these are , and making them at home sure beats starbucks prices.
1	i &apos;ve tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same. however , this and the italian blend by timothy &apos;s are two that are very good black or with cream / sugar. if you &apos;re looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors , this is the one for you.
1	human-grade chicken , all organic dog food. the food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the subscribe &amp; save program. the profits benefit pet charities. what &apos;s not to like ?
1	candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price. i was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me.
1	sweetarts evokes nostalgic memories of going into the candy store and pining for that sweet and sour chalky taste of this classic candy. while it &apos;s a hard candy it is easily chewable and has pleasant texture and taste. you really can &apos;t go wrong with this candy. the only drawback is it is hard to stop at just one and before you know it you &apos;ve eaten an entire roll.
1	this product is great tasting ! i was eating the pepitas at half the price due to not finding usa made pumpkin seeds. the pepitas tasted bitter and were much larger. i hope red mill continues to make their pumpkin seeds in the usa. it &apos;s worth the higher price for excellent quality and supporting local usa companies.
1	of all the flavors of tic tacs , these are my favorite. great wild cherry flavor. love them ! ! too bad they aren &apos;t more readily available to purchase locally.
0	i will never understand the soaps from mainstream , and sometimes otherwise great brands , who claim to have a line of &quot; sensitive skin &quot; products which still contain sodium lauryl or laureth ( as in this case ) sulfate. if you &apos;re someone who needs sensitive skin products there &apos;s a more than decent chance that you also need stuff without sls. boo. refer to their bar soap , which is wonderful.
1	we like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. they are even great by themselves. we will order these as long as they are available. thank you for making them accessable. shelly kenyon
0	we repotted about a dozen houseplants a month ago with miracal gro potting soil. i &apos;ve sprayed the soil with indoor insecticide and these little bugs just look up at me a laugh. insecticidal soap doesn &apos;t faze them either. let &apos;s see ... miracle gro is a division of ortho and ortho sells bug spray. conspiracy theories anyone ?
1	my husband said it tastes wonderful ! ! just like you would get in a restaurant .... creamy and flavorful ! hightly recommends this product !
0	i bought this because the store was out of my brand. i was disappointed with this coffee. not very flavorful , and the flavor is just ok. wouldn &apos;t buy again.
0	while these were so cute to look at , when i tasted them and had other people give them a try , the overwhelming response was yuk.
1	i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma are for $ 4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $ 38.00 yes 3 for a dollar. i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.
0	gum sticks to my teeth and flavor doesn &apos;t last long at all. it &apos;s ok for vending machine gum and it was a decent price but the gum itself is not that good.
1	even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. we had no problem with the shipment , but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight. other than that we are happy : d
1	i &apos;m sorry not everyone likes this mix , but we love it. it is like going to a gourmet restaurant ! ( yeah - a gourmet waffle restaurant ... ) the waffles taste and turn out great , and so easy. hard for us to believe , but it seems it &apos;s not for everyone.
0	my dog can &apos;t seem to figure this one out. no matter how much he tugs on it , the food doesn &apos;t come out. we prefer the kong wobbler. this was a waste of our money.
1	if you cannot eat regular chocolate , these are just wonderful. yummy. for diabetics and people who are choosing not to eat sugar ( plus fewer calories ) these are very tasty.
1	i have mccann &apos;s oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost $ 3.00 per box. it is a great product. tastes great and very healthy
0	i have never tasted this coffee. but when people brew it in my house , it makes my house smell like farts. it might taste really good , but i can &apos;t get over the fart smell. you &apos;ve been warned.
0	these crackers are great. unfortunately , every box i &apos;ve bought is about 50 % broken. and that &apos;s from several different stores.
1	i need every color that is available ! love this product ! ! received shipment very fast ! very happy with this product , will buy more.
0	herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste. it is only for people who like herbal taste. i don &apos;t.
1	terrific with english triffle. beware though the pack of 6 ; each of the 6 containers makes about a gallon of pudding.
1	at first , i was concerned about ordering babka online but i kinda missed this one. as i tasted it the only thing i could say was : &quot; wow &quot; . i will order this again for sure.
1	i use this for iced tea and it is just so much better than american teas - it just plain is ! it is all i buy , and now i get it for others too. look no further.
1	my 8 yo is a kettle chip addict so i was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch ! ! ! great quality and much cheaper than in the stores ! ! ! will definitely be buying more !
1	i found these chips on vacation in oregon. the store was a kind of natural yet upscale type of grocery store. i had never seen them before. they are different than regular chips-no oily taste but very flavorful. i didn &apos;t know if i could get them in ca so i ordered a case !
1	i love the flavor and the speed of this cocoa i drink one at night and each is the same good stuff.
0	we ordered the product ... our dog loves them ... but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside. recieved in one big melted ball. thought they would ship in dry ice. if its summer or hot in your area dont order them ! !
0	the product will not dissolve ! ! ! and it tastes ok ( drinkable ) but more like cool aid or orange soda even when added to orange juice. i cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product as dissolving is vitally important and it has a problem with that. appears i &apos;ve wasted some money.
1	i was quite surprised to find that sociables were available thru amazon. i cannot find them in the local supermarkets and thought i would have to give them up. they arrived quickly , in great condition , and we now are on regular shipments of them.
1	nice flavor , not too bitter. we really like this coffee. we have been searching for a coffee that pleases the whole family &apos;s tastes and this is the one.
1	i found these cups to be easy to use , and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee.
0	received the wrong item and called to complain. the person who answered the phone was completely unprofessional and sounded incoherent. at first he told me he could help me then told me to call back when a supervisor was available. next call , my credit card company. i almost neglected to mention that the incorrect order i received contained a packing slip with someone else &apos;s address and credit card info. scary stuff here.
1	i used these for my sons bday party as one of the sweet treats to have out. they are great , the kids all loved them and the price was fabulous , way better than purchasing elsewhere. the item came as described and was fresh. thank you amazon.com
1	i found out about this spice blend in dallas a few years back when i persuaded a waitress to tell me what the restaurant was using on the grilled shrimp. i like this cajun spice for grilling fish. recommend , but store it in a dry place and replace it every year or so at least , or it will lose its flavor.
0	i will never buy this item again ! ! i was addicted to it until the last order ! ! fruits had foul smell , tasted rotten ! ! was the expiration dates forged ! ?
0	i was very disappointed by the product. they are not long lasting as i was lead to believe. i was going to buy chewlotta &apos;s which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1 , but i thought it was too pricey at $ 3 a pop. my dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours. he does enjoy them though.
1	my dog will do anything for these treats. buying a five pound bag lasts about a year and they are dry so they are easy to put in your pocket and they last forever.
1	my 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much , but as time went on i found more and more uses for it. i have so many recipes that i make weekly that i &apos;m running out ! this is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything i &apos;ve found in the grocery store.
1	there are a ton of vanilla beans in this package. they are supple and so fragrant , you can smell them without breaking the seal. truly a fantastic deal.
0	be careful if you have a chocolate allergy. the last box i purchased has cocoa powder as the ingredient and the cones are brown. i know previous boxes did not contain cocoa powder and were a normal cone color. the distributor should market these as chocolate cones and not try to pass them off as something else. note : be especially leary since this seller doesn &apos;t list ingredients.
1	just like old style jerky. whole strips of meat , not compressed chips. yum yum. peppery.
1	my picky eater loves this flavor. each jar is 110 calories &amp; 5 grams of fat so this momma loves this flavor as well. i &apos;m ordering more because it &apos;s the one flavor ( besides green beans ) that i know my son will eat.
1	this coffee is really rich , perfect in the morning. i ordered it for the office , but it was going fast. after a day or so i decided it was too good / fine to share so i swapped it out w / some cheap stuff and brought it home. more for me !
1	my daughter loved this stuff. it is all natural and made very well. good to mix with other things as they get older too ! beats gerber.
1	green mountain is my favorite brand. nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain. very smooth flavor. not too strong and not too weak.
1	this product is great. just add egg , water , and butter ( i used oil ) . i will never make waffles from scratch again.
1	great popcorn ! ! good popping results and wonderful flavor. can &apos;t help but love it and i will re-order when i run out. recommend to one and all
0	and they are drastically lower in quality. do a brief search on the equivalent of the usda or dept of animal welfare in china. guess what ? no existo. do not buy.
1	my husband has diabetes and has to watch what he eats .... this is a great and healthy treat for him ! i couldn &apos;t find it at local stores , and was happy to see it available on amazon !
1	the pop-chips are great. i had heard they were really good and i totally agree. i love being able to have all the flavors. i like the variety. the chips were delivered quickly and safely.
1	i do a lot of &quot; from scratch &quot; gluten free cooking but there is nothing that can replace bisquick. from the ease of morning pancakes to using it in other reciepes in place of other mixes there is simply nothing that i cannot do with this little box.
0	the coffee is good but the price is ridiculous ( $ 1.25 each k-cup approx ) . you can get it from green mountain for 75 cents a k-cup ( delivered ) which is still too much. buy it for 60 cents a k-cup at bed , bath and beyond or kohls.
1	i have found this product , kettle chips unsalted to be fabulous. i found them by accident on amazon after hunting all over my local stores. they are crisp and tasty without all of the salt.
0	all of my cans were dented. some cans had multiple dents. if we were told that and / or if they were discounted , i could make the choice ; however , this was just a case of a manufacturer making extra money on dented cans and taking advantage of the customers. gdn
0	opened a can that &apos;s not set to expire for another year and it was awful and rancid smelling. rancid grains are toxic and it is terribly irresponsible of them to let this problem persist in food made for babies ! ! i won &apos;t buy their products again.
0	it only lasted 2 days. came mostly dead. glad it was only 10 bucks. it was also very small so. the flies i wanted it to eat , it couldn &apos;t.
0	my husband and i were excited to try them. we bought pineapple , beer , lemon , lime , hot peppers , cheese and wine. the only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. the lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. we each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was.
1	if you like bloody mary &apos; s and dirty martinies this is a must. you won &apos;t be sorry. i &apos;m so glad i found this product.
1	even though the chowder is very very good as is - i add a can of the bar harbor chopped clams to it - along with a can of heavy cream and a huge pat of &apos; budda &apos; .... yummy ...
0	this used to be a good product before they started watering it down , which is why i quit buying it.
1	i have started the extraction process less than a month ago , and so far it looks and smell wonderful. waiting to try it.i have put 6 oz in 1.75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful. i plan on using the other 2 oz. in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc.
0	my 7 month old lab mastered the toy in about an hour. he managed to chew through the rope and render this toy about as useful as a gatorade bottle with no top.
0	after multiple tries its always the same , the popcorn pops about 50 % . it is definitely bad popcorn because i succesfully used the oil pack with my own popcorn and achieved great results. i found it interesting that there is no date code on either the case or the packages. isn &apos;t there a law about that or something ?
1	these chips are some of the best i &apos;ve tasted. they are not filled with chemicals. you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato. not greasy. perfectly crispy. if you don &apos;t like salt and vinegar tanginess , don &apos;t even bother to try. these definitely have zip. i love them. my children and their friends love them. even my 4 year old loves them !
0	maybe i got the runt of the litter , but when i opened the bag , the foul musty / moldy smell hit me in the face. even though the label ( which was just a printed sticker as opposed to something stamped on the bag itself ) said good until 1 / 2013 , there was no doubt that the food had gone bad. very disappointing.
1	i &apos;m not much of a chocolate and peanut butter person , but these chocolates are the perfect combination of both. the different flavors have definitely made me a fan.
0	6 out of the 12 cans are very dented ! very disappointed. please send me 6 more ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this was a gift.
1	walked into a convenience store and bought this for .99 and was like , nice. asked the counter person if i could buy it at their rate and got the brush off. did a little research and voila ! amazon comes through again. bought two jars , and the wife and kids cleaned me out. i will be getting this sent to me monthly soon.
1	i bought this as my first pack of k-cups , its definitely a good buy ! assortments are always a little more expensive , this one is very well priced. you get 6 of each and one of them only has 5 , thank god they picked decaf for the small one ! great coffee , if i hadn &apos;t discovered club keurig i would still be buying these !
1	i love this body wash ! it smells nice , works great , and feels great on your skin. add in the fact that with the subscribe and save deal , it is a great value , i &apos;m sold !
1	second order. very good , hot which i like but best to sample as per your preferences.
1	snappy &apos;s white popcorn is perfect. it &apos;s hulless , tiny , tender and crunchy when popped , and it always pops. we keep it in the freezer so it &apos;s always fresh , and more importantly , always here when we want some. as midwesterners , we know corn , okay ? and this is the best !
1	i &apos;m not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict , gave this a shot. the tuna tastes like it &apos;s good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland. it &apos;s better than something plain but it didn &apos;t pack the punch i was hoping for. it &apos;s still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal.
0	t may be expresso grind , but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker : think again. bitter when drunk on own. marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. i shoulda known betta !
1	i loved these chips. they were exactly what i had been looking for. they are not fried / greasy or baked / dry they were great-tasting , satisfying , and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. you can feel good about eating these chips. can &apos;t say enough , you &apos;ll have to try them for yourself ! i am ordering more now !
0	these treats don &apos;t last , my dog can pop them out in a matter of minutes , and it &apos;s completely gone in about 5 minutes. add to that the seller i purchased from only sent me one ( they come in packs of 2 , seller opened it and only sent me one treat ) , i was very disappointed. never going to bother with these again.
0	not very good and i love bold coffee. kona coffee and pretty much tulleys brand in general is much better.
1	used this in moroccan recipes , as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water. wonderful , wonderful stuff !
1	as you know finding a hot chocolate that taste great and is brewed on the keurig is a big challenge. well this hot chocolate is quite good. the flavor is rich and the hot chocolate has some creaminess to it. i made it for my daughter and toped it off with whipped cream and she loved it. will be drinking lots of this on now that it is begining to get colder.
1	our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. the cheap &apos; you can buy it anywhere &apos; food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets. this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food. this message is ramsey frankenstein approved.
1	these spicy chips have a lot of great flavor but be warned , you will be left with some stanky breath afterwards ! the first time i ate these was at night and then even after brushing and flossing i could taste them in my mouth the next morning. so just be careful about when you eat them , especially if you will be hanging out with people later in the day.
1	these are not as good at houston &apos;s samba grill but they tasted great. the texture is different but in lieu of having these on a daily basis , i have found something that i can make. i would surely recommend these to anyonr.
0	this toy did not last. i have a boxer and he chewed the rope off the jar.
0	do not buy ! review online ! looks like another treat made in china with multiple reports of suspected poisoning ! ! ! please only buy treats made in the usa !
1	i love this tea which has a deep cinnamon aroma and taste. it &apos;s equally good as an iced tea. full marks !
0	this is not xapp recovery as is listed , it is xapp energy. the difference is that xapp energy contains caffeine.
0	i don &apos;t like strong coffee but this is so weak and watery , it &apos;s like drinking ... something other than coffee. i tried brewing a small size , using a different size cup , adjusting my cream and sugar , nothing works ! it &apos;s really disappointing because i &apos;ve had other good blends from green mountain in the past. i &apos;ll stick with wolfgang puck &apos;s rodeo drive or breakfast in bed.
1	i buy mostly for vending , so the size of the bag is important. kettle &apos;s 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. salt &amp; vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10.
0	fast shipping. smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. not recommended.
1	my honey has a serious sweet tooth , which i accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. martha white &apos;s muffin mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk , which i toss into my cuisinart ; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. they are moist , delicious , and economic.
0	i enjoyed these mints for many years ... they are now terrible because of the changes that wrigley has made to them. get rid of the color and put back the flavor. i will not buy them again unless they are changed back.
0	the company does not operate properly i ordered the french vanilla. that is the selection i clicked on and i recieved the white chocolate. they should contact a buyer before shipping a substitution.
1	not only are the truffles excellent , but the package arrived in record speed with standard shipping chosen. we are very pleased with our truffles and with our experience with this company. we will be ordering from them again !
0	i too was a little disappointed with the mix of the donut sampler. in my case i had 12 of the 35 were decaf. but i guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the amazon warehouse deals section. all the k-cups had a best used by date of 6 / 2012. i was happy about that atleast.
0	and they definitely do , being as i tried out this whole 24 pack. they taste alright and not too much fat or calories but i dont know why but they give me gas ! ! at first i was confused but then i realised when i ate them is when id later stink up the room. never again !
1	my husband and i both really like the popchips. they are a great substitute for regular potato chips and we both find them very satisfying.
1	i ordered this for my daughter , who does not like coffee. she says it is the best tasting tea , and it brews perfectly with the keurig. also like the large quantity box.
0	i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. this bone was not the solution. there is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. i threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
1	i love these chips. they are addictive ... it &apos;s hard to just eat a few. i tried the chili flavor that has great reviews and i don &apos;t think they compare to the salsa fresca. if you like a chip with a little kick ... these are perfect.
0	see &apos;s makes delicious chocolates ; close to the best ; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. i think that every one should boycott see &apos;s for that reason.
1	premium ghiradelli chocolate mixed with just a hit of coffee makes this a great drink. i &apos;ve gotten to where i add a heaping spoonful to my starbucks coffee every morning. it gives it an extra coffee flavor and the chocolate for ghiradelli far exceeds the &apos; mocha &apos; chocolate you get at most barista stands.
0	bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. i actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn &apos;t just my nose playing tricks on me. i love this brand and i am very disappointed.
1	love these cups ! i hated paying so much for my beloved keurig coffees , the cups work great , they are convenient , easy to use and i can use whatever coffee i choose ! ! ! ! !
0	if you are ordering cookies , beware , the &apos; cookies &apos; arrived in crumbles , so , if you want a box of stale crumbs order away : )
1	yuban has been my coffee of choice for 20 years. the price at amazon is very good. i recommend this product for any coffee lover.
1	chi-chi &apos;s sweet corn cake is awesome. the stores in our area stopped stocking this item. so happy to have found it on amazon.com. no other corn bread / cake mix comes close to being as good as this. it goes great with taco &apos;s , nacho &apos;s and chili. we also like to add in some frozen corn before we bake it. yum ! ! ! !
1	this is a terrific deal for a coffee lover that needs to cut back on his / her caffeine consumption. great tasting coffee and great deal. can spend over $ 5 for it at the grocery store. i get mine by the subscription plan for a little over $ 4 plus no tax.
1	we have several of these machines at work and i &apos;ve tried lots of different flavors and blends ... this is one of the few i can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder. lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong. this one is actually very tasty.
1	this was a very interesting drink ! it was refreshing , tasty and healthy ! it was very tangerine tasting , no after taste and very refreshing !
1	i tried these bars and they were very good , although i do like the peanut butter chocolate chip bars better. the bars are a quick and easy to carry snack when you are on the go !
0	food is very much a personal preference but i really don &apos;t like any of these crackers made by this company. they taste like flavored paper. someone said better than nothing but i &apos;d rather have something else.
1	this mix is probably not something you would want to use everyday. its just new enough and different enough to be something special to add to your summertime recipe &apos;s. when you want to reward yourself with something fun and fruity , this can fill the bill quickly and easily. it has no aftertaste so often associated with diet drinks. i highly recommend it.
0	this is one of my favorite cereals. but purchase it only if you don &apos;t mind eating it in powder form. what you get is mostly powder , not crunchy squares. i will not be ordering again , sorry.
0	i have a bichon and i thought this would entertain him for at least 15 minutes , but it didn &apos;t. he solved it quickly , within 5 minutes and looked at me as if to say , that &apos;s all ?
0	by the time these little rocks tell you that your plant needs water , your plant will be dead. great idea and just didn &apos;t pan out.
0	my son wouldn &apos;t eat it either ! i tasted it ... i would not eat it , also. tasteless , unappetizing in texture and flavor. it says &quot; minimal processing &quot; ... does that mean it is not even cooked ? no wonder our babies and toddlers hate it ! ! ! i would never knowingly feed my child or myself raw meat.
1	these beans were vacuum sealed , very fresh and supple. my only problem was that there were so many i had way more than what i needed for a dozen jars of vanilla flavoring that i &apos;m preparing as christmas gifts. highly recommend.
1	everyone should try these chips. they are healthier than regular chips. and they taste good.
1	as a professional potato chip muncher , i see these as thee very best on the market. rich taste and flavor ! ! almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.the true meaning of decadence !
0	i transplanted a ficus to a larger pot ( no gnats previously ) , and soon after our bathroom was infested with gnats. i like the response i get from my plants outdoors with miraclegro &apos;s potting mix , but i will never use this again for indoor plants.
0	these were a little disappointing. the hot chocolate is very watery and the flavor is a bit strange ... kind of plastic tasting. haven &apos;t been able to find a good brand of hot chocolate for keurig
1	i have purchased other hot cocoa cups but find grove square to be about the best of them all. i usually add two teaspoons of the the flavored coffeemate creamers , my favorite being the sugar free caramel macchiato. by adding the sugar free creamer the taste is there but not the calories.
1	the breeder of my puppy uses this , and i continued to feed with this supplement. dog loves the taste , and makes her boring dry food more interesting- she gobbles it up. i notice her coat is beautiful. good ingredients. i would recommend this.
1	these things work very well. the only trouble i &apos;ve had with them is if you leave one in the machine overnight , it sticks and is hard to get out. otherwise , a great product ! ! !
1	these are some pretty darn good nuts with some spicy bite. they wont change your life , but they are good. the double entendre in the name is a serious bonus.
1	have only had the need to use this a few times , but it has always performed well and consistently. nice that it has a little preamp so you can control levels - doesn &apos;t seem to color the tone in any negative way.
0	with both a stomach problem and a love of coffee , i thought this would be a great solution. i was wrong. i just didn &apos;t care for the taste. i recommend trying some low acid coffee once somewhere you can get a small cup before purchasing a 10-pack of bags for home brew. : (
1	i had only tried the barbeque and sea salt and vinegar flavors that were available at my local target in 3oz. bags. i am so glad that i bought this variety pack ! not only did i discover other flavors that i enjoy , but it &apos;s single serving size so it &apos;s better for portion control. i love popchips , and i find them way more satisfying than ordinary potato chips !
1	this product is a quick snack very light and tasteful with any spread or just like it is. takes up hardly ay space if a couple of packets are placed in your bag. individually wrapped crackers makes it stay fresh for longer periods.
0	my dog had this for 30 minutes before he chewed through the knot. he then went on to chewing the rubber off the nozzle. my dog was 9mo old and weighed 26lbs. loved the idea of it. disappointed that i spent $ 12 on a toy that lasted less then an hour.
1	i have tried all the different brands of coconut water and o.n.e. is my favorite and o.n.e. coconut water with a splash of pineapple is my favorite flavor. i wish the price would come back down i absolutely love this stuff !
1	i already have the bluebird from blue and was using it to record a friend &apos;s live performance. with only a laptop computer at my disposal , i was able to connect my xlr to usb directly into garageband. the icicle is small , portable , and so easy to use-- plus , i didn &apos;t have to carry a huge a to d converter !
0	these are so not tasty. it is like eating a green tea bag with peanut butter and chocolate. i do not recommend purchasing these.
0	although the description states that the salt-free version of cavender &apos;s contains no msg , beware. i sprinkled a little of this on beef last night while cooking it , and my intestines are still talking back to me 12 hours later ! &apos; flavor base seasoning &apos; and &apos; five other spices &apos; are both mystery ingredients in this mixture , that probably contain msg. not for msg sensitive people !
0	i ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it. she said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died. i wish i had known sooner but she just told me last week.
1	kellogg &apos;s mueslix had replaced local muesli previously served in european b &amp; b &apos;s on our last trip. not available locally , but amazon provided with a fair price , rapid delivery and no shipping cost with my prime shipping. excellent form of muesli !
0	i wasted my money. i tried putting different cereal , dog foods , etc. in this , and my dog ignores it completely.
1	since being diagnosed with high blood pressure , this product has been a staple in our home. i especially enjoy the grilling blends. for the price i got it for online it was a great deak , usually much more expensive in store , so buying in bulk from amazon is the way to go.
0	used to subscribe to this item , as my dogs loved them , but i just found that they are made in china. i will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company.
1	try these first for all your seafood soups and stews. they &apos;re just amazing. the flavor enhances all your seafood and just makes it wonderful. plus , these are great just to snack on out of the bag. kids love them ! we use them for chilis , soups , and recipes as well. highly recommend !
1	i like all the varieties except the salt and pepper. they taste too much like black pepper and nothing else. the others are very goodl &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001rvfdoo &quot; &gt; popchips 6-flavor variety pack , 0.8-ounce single serve bags ( pack of 24 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	if you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn , this product will not deliver. it tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say , &apos; improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt &apos; . i would recommend anything by kernal season &apos;s brand ... that tastes like cheese. but if you like a salty tasting popcorn , this is the seasoning for you ...
1	these crackers are perfect ... you know why ? because they have a subtle light flavour that doesn &apos;t overpower whatever you &apos;re eating on top of them ... whether it be guacamole , hummus , or mustard and cheese ... : )
1	great on any thing from rice to pasta to burgers. i cant wait until the week end for my favorite over easy eggs , hash browns , and this mix. more heat than you would expect , have tried a couple other brands , not the same ....
1	this is by far the most delicious snack you could ever have ! ! the almonds are super fresh and crunchy and the light coating of syrup is not too sweet. my whole family loves it ! !
1	since i cannot eat sugar , and there are so few healthy options out there , this is perfect for my chocolate fix !
0	i bought these cookies after reading all the rave reviews but they were very dry , didn &apos;t have much chocolate , and left an unpleasant aftertaste. i don &apos;t understand what all the fuss is about. if these were the only gf cookies available , i still wouldn &apos;t buy them again.
1	good things come in small packages ! ! this is an excellent non-soda thirst quencher. no sugar but an outstanding taste ! !
1	our local stores all stopped carrying this product and were putting their own imitation brands on the shelf ...... just not the same ! great that i could order and have my cereal within days !
0	great product - 5 stars but my review is on pricing only. you can buy stubbs marinade at a whole foods ( a.k.a. whole paycheck to some ) for $ 4.49 / bottle.
1	if you want a really good snack bar try these , they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar , but without the gluten ! ! i buy these regularly.
1	i purchased this product because i have previously used it and it is not always easy to locate on store shelves. i prefer it to other powdered custard ( pudding ) products for ease of making and taste. it &apos;s wonderful in trifles or just about any pudding type dessert you want to make. amazon gets the product to you almost immediately and at a reasonable price.
1	best one in k cups todate not watery like several of the others i have tried. will now join the subscribe and save group ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b005k4q64k &quot; &gt; grove square hot cocoa cups variety pack , k-cups for keurig brewers , 12-count ( pack of 3 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	i &apos;ve been buying and drinking this for over a year now , and the energy boost is excellent , with a continuous , ~ 6-hour effect. the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well , or perhaps i &apos;m getting more used to it. i don &apos;t drink it for the flavor , but it &apos;s not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other , non-organic energy shots.
1	i ordered these a while back off of amazon. the mild flavor and firm texture is great. when they are available here they are about 2 / 3 &apos;s the cost of my local super market. they are always good no matter where i buy them. i just wish amazon kept them in stock all the time.
1	i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best. now , i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product.
0	i wish i had read that these are made in china before i bought them. they are going in the trash - lesson learned.
0	these lollipops are not as pictured. they came in assorted colors , some really drab , not the rainbow brights shown in the picture. they are also completely flat rather than being the rolled old fashioned candy style so they look cheap. i need them for a birthday party and i was really disappointed when i received them.
0	when i read that these were &quot; long lasting &quot; i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. not happy with this nylabone purchase !
1	this is excellent. this is the best gf mix i &apos;ve yet to try in over five years of trying it all. it &apos;s not grainy , none of that rice grainy thing going on at all. the texture of everything i &apos;ve used it for has been excellent. this is a winner. the price is a bummer , but the product is amazing.
0	was pleased with the packaging and prompt delivery however every single package was empty. no coffee inside. no broken seals or holes , just nicely sealed empty k-cups. would like coffee with my coffee
0	earth &apos;s best is supposed to be one of the best baby foods , but apparently my son does not have a palate for their food. maybe he did not like the texture of this stuff ( it looks gritty ) . he normally eats anything but was very sluggish with this food ... turning his head after a couple of bites.
1	i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review. the flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. the color is that of muddy water , and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. well worth every penny.
0	okay , a lot of chicken breast treats from china are causing dogs to be sick ( see the fda website for details ) . this is not one of them , but when i started buying it , it was made in the usa. now it &apos;s made in china. although my dogs have long loved this treat , i &apos;m in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country.
0	this one has a major problem. it &apos;s waaaay too watery , even at the recommended settings. the chocolate flavor is okay , and it &apos;s not overly sweet ( although it still isn &apos;t great dark chocolate flavor ) . the really issue is that there isn &apos;t any creaminess , and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. blech ! i &apos;ll pass , and i &apos;m throwing the rest of the box out.
1	this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best i &apos;ve ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don &apos;t. i my self happen to like it and will buy again unless i find something better.
1	i love this tea. i have issues with added flowers and flavorings in other teas and revolution teas tell you exactly whats in it and there are no additives ! i have been ordering from them ever since my first box of tea. i take it to the office and i have a travel container and take it with me to restaurants.
1	this popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. what a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
0	i gave this product a one because zero wasn &apos;t an option. this is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it. the only lobster in the soup was some shell. it was salty , fishy , nasty and inedible. not only that , but 11 of the 12 cans were dented. a complete waste of money. beyond disappointing. it made me angry.
1	i adore these k-cups ! on a keto diet , it can be hard to find pre-made drinks that aren &apos;t loaded with sugar. with these guys , i can control the sugar content but still enjoy that perfect glass of iced tea.
0	the soup taste terrible. the picture with big chunks of chicken is extremely misleading. there is almost no chicken in the soup.
1	i first discovered &quot; gluten free biscuit &quot; in the supermarket. i bought it and loved it. i then tried to find it again in all the local supermarkets , but could not find it. i called the manufacturer and they informed me that i could purchase it at amazon. i was thrilled. amazon is one of my favorite web sites.
1	i brew the 8 oz cups , 10 and 12 makes it too thin. it &apos;s good at that point but adding some creamer , whipped cream , and or cinamin always improves it.
1	absolutely love the habenaro sauce ... use it on eggs , sandwiches most anything for a good kick ! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product ... have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product .. get out there and try it !
1	i won &apos;t claim to be a professional food taster ... i just know what i like and don &apos;t like. i don &apos;t like &quot; yellow &quot; popcorn , i don &apos;t like microwave popcorn , i like the &quot; white &quot; popcorn cooked in a pan. for my &quot; popping style &quot; the baby white pops great w / o lots of hard kernels. &apos; nuf said.
1	i almost can &apos;t stop eating this cereal ... i eat it for breakfast and then in the evening , when i think i want something to eat and am really not hungry , i snack on these. after all , it &apos;s healthy , so long as i remembeer it &apos;s not healthy to eat a cup or more. enjoy !
0	we tried this formula because it is lactose free , my baby does not have any other issues , just lactose intolerant. we found that it smells bad , does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop.
1	these k-cups are awesome. they taste no different ( personally , i think better ) than those which are priced three times as much ! i highly recommend this product !
1	kids loved it. great product at a great price. my little one can make her own hot cocoa without my assistance.
1	we love this brand of freeze dried fruit and veggies. they make it easy to have healthy on the go snacks for our 2 year old !
0	the product was very good. why i gave it 1 star was the poor packaging and all the broken cookies.
1	these taste great and are a healthier alternative. my favorite was the sea salt and vinegar. i probably won &apos;t order the other flavors again since i have a favorite , and don &apos;t eat potato chips all that often. but the variety pack was great to get to try them all.
1	great price for the 24-count , my dad will love this gift since he loves hot chocolate and drinks about three cups a day , quick to receive.
0	they were stale and hard. had to suck on them to get them soft enough to chew them. won &apos;t buy again.
1	this sweetner is the best , it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. and it has great health benefts.
0	to make a decent cup of coffee i have to use two pods at a time. i prefer a strong cup of coffee even if it is decaf. what happened to senseo decaf ?
0	besides being smaller than runts , they look the same and have the same consistency. unfortunately , they taste nothing like banana runts ... nor do they even taste good. yucky stuff. trying to return with vendor.
1	this mix is great anytime. i love it. would recommend it to anyone that likes chex mix.
0	my son &apos;s celiac so we &apos;re very familiar with gluten free products. i bought these because i trust the glutino brand name but really , they &apos;re just not that great. we tried them once and that was it because they &apos;re bland and tasteless. there are better gluten free alternatives out there.
1	i brought some of this back from a trip to jamaica and wished i had bought it by the gallon. it is very hard to find but well worth ordering in bulk ! it is a sweet but spicy sauce that takes me back to jamaica with every taste. i have attempted to duplicate it many times but can &apos;t seem to get it right. i am ecstatic to finally have found a source.
0	we have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past , but this order is inferior. did the company change hands or outsource their production ?
0	i love the idea of champagne truffles , but these weren &apos;t it. they were flavorless and unimpressive. we ended up throwing away half of the box.
0	the sugar salt combo season is so bad that i soaked them in water , washed out the canister and air dried them. then and only then were they tasty.
0	i dont like the taste of this at all. i have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic. cant remember exact name but think it is something like mb - is a french company and i got it in canada and by mail order after that. it is much better to my taste. never dreamed there would be this much variance among fennel seeds as only ingredient.
1	i enjoy a good cup of hot cocoa on occasion , and this is &quot; good stuff &quot; ! ! not only that but in a time where prices are out of control on k-cups , this product is very reasonable in price.
1	what can i say ... if you &apos;ve had popchips in the past and love them ... then no better place to pick them up ... i love these chips and have bought them without an issue from amazon. thanks
0	these are not the greatest. thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come. not so. they were not what i had expected.
1	hard to find on the store shelves. doesn &apos;t over power the flavors you put on it.
1	these are the best ! what a wonderful way to provide a treat for yourself and your kids knowing how healthy and pure they are. the taste is excellant and satisfies that sweet tooth. highly recommend that you try these.
0	i love thinkthin bars , but just a warning here. there &apos;s no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts. the last ingredient in the fine print is peanut flour and it sent my son into a tailspin. i &apos;m a very careful consumer on that front and ultimately , i should have known , but their other non-peanut butter flavors are just fine. so heads up.
1	i received my box of assorted popchips a few days ago to support my weight watcher meal plan. i absolutely love them and find that they fit in with my plan. without hesitation i recommend all varieties of these chips. what a great idea ! ! !
1	we love to get masaman curry at our local thai restaurant , but i haven &apos;t been able to find a paste that actually tastes like it. this paste does , and is very easy to prepare. just add some coconut milk and heat - add your protein and veggies of choice , done ! i have now bought some of the other mae ploy products , and found them all very good quality with authentic flavors.
1	this by far the best pudding mix , you don &apos;t see this on the store shelves .. everyone seems to just buy milk chocolate pudding .. and i guess most don &apos;t like to cook pudding on the stove , it is best when pudding is cooked cooked .. instant pudding does not equal this .. carl
0	i would like to tell this company that the whole box of bars had melted and then it was so crumbly to eat it was a mess i don &apos;t want to spend the money to send them back it &apos;s so expensive but wish they would send me another box that was not melted and falling apart. what do you do about that ?
0	they are taking advantage of pricing and selling this item at 200 % mark up. you can get it at keurig.com at half the price
1	i love this cereal. not only does it taste good , it &apos;s good for you. it &apos;s a pity that i can &apos;t find this cereal in any of the local supermarkets. other brands do not match up.
1	i &apos;ve purchased bulk candies where they are old , terrible flavors , or simply smashed to dust. this was a great buy , having none of those drawbacks.
0	the dressing is made with flax oil which is supposed to be beneficial. however , there are some people who would chant &quot; fat is fat &quot; and scoff at the idea that one oil is better for you ( me ) than another. the dressing , itself , has a metallic taste i don &apos;t care for. i won &apos;t be buying it again.
0	my girls hated it. they gagged as soon as they smelled it .... and so did i ! so gross ! ! like dog food but worse.
1	great product - brought it for a gift and will be buying some more for me. user friendly product , easy to use and works with any kcup machine
1	i bought this before i realized how much i was getting and before i knew they had it at the grocery store ! that was my own fault. i really should have waited. but the seeds are great , i just have way too many in my freezer !
0	be careful that you know what you are getting. i have a bichon frise , and a 12 &quot; bull stick is a bit long for her to handle. the written description says each bull stick is 6 &quot; , which is what i wanted. the package shows more than one , whereas i received one 12 &quot; stick for that price. much too long for a smaller dog.
1	bought this for my chocolate lover boyfriend and he loved it ! he shared it with me and they were delicious. thank you !
0	didn &apos;t realize it was flavored and thought , when i had my first sip , that it tasted like chemicals. f-. gave it away the next day at work.
0	this product have no flavor at all , i could not taste apple or any other ! it was just something sweet. also it had a bad smell ! am used to the haribo bears , sold in the us market , they have a noticeable taste , they are made in turkey. while these bad frogs are made is spain .... maybe that why they taste and smell funny ! ! ?
1	i ordered this assorted bartons turkish delight 6in1 it is delicious .i took it to my parents house for my sister &apos;s birthday among her gifts which i also bought at amazon everyone at the party loved this turkish delight so much they even wanted to buy it for them and i told them amazon go there they have everything , amazon thank you as allways bringing us international flavors without leaving our homes.
1	every bit as good as any other brand i &apos;ve tried. fantastic taste and easy to use. this stuff can become addictive.
0	tried this by adding the tomato paste , diced tomatoes and ground turkey. we normally make turkey chili from scratch and love it. this , however , was not good. ended up popping tums. watch out - - too much garlic.
1	i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in brittany france and thought it was delicious ! i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that , i love this product !
1	it was so easy to grow and my cat loved it. i highly recommend this purchase. your cat will love you forever !
1	i have had waffles from other mixes that are too sweet. i have also made them from scratch. i like my waffles with no sugar in them , because i don &apos;t like too much sugar. this mix is very good. waffles are just the right consitancy for me and the mix is easy to prepare.
0	this soup is just offensive. why does it taste like cinnamon ? also , it &apos;s twice the price of campbell &apos;s and 1 / 4 the chicken. sure , it says it &apos;s organic. i totally believe that , don &apos;t you ?
1	erin baker &apos;s products are a favorite for my family. the breakfast cookie mini &apos;s are great for snacks &amp; coffee breaks and especially good for traveling. this is a denser product than a regular cookie , nice and chewy and filling with only 100 calories.
1	good product. almost all the popcorn pops up fluffy and snow white. with our air popper , great snack with few calories. taste great !
1	alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much.
0	used this piece of junk to stuff olives with blue cheese for martinis. after two olives it bacame clear that the olivator was not up to the task. it &apos;s poorly-designed ( falls apart ) and much slower than stuffing the olives by hand. it cannot handle sticky material like blue cheese and then you have to clean it.
0	i simply don &apos;t like it. it is easy to prepare , but when i eat it , i feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. i cannot even finish one fourth of it .....
0	i can &apos;t believe i wasted almost $ 20 on this. they were burned ! they were inedible ! it was so nasty and they took forever to arrive ! you should take this product off of your product list. worst product i &apos;ve ever ordered
1	my children can not have wheat , gluten , soy , dairy , eggs ... it is very hard to find products that they can have. we use this for pancakes , pizza crust , cakes. basically we just use it in place of flour. it is so nice to be able to buy bisquick in the grocery stores now ; however it is much cheaper through amazon !
1	this is the best popcorn i have ever had. as a kid i ran the popcorn machine in a theater so i feel i know what i &apos;m talking about. we used yellow popcorn but i still think white is best.
1	my dog thinks he was born into the gentry and is entitled to fine dining each evening. accordingly , he will not eat plain kibble. a scoop of this on his dry food , a little water to make gravy and we &apos;re good to go. ordering a case from amazon was way easier than picking up individual cans at the pet store , too. all in all , a success for us.
0	love the taste of this product , really keeps you full with just a small amount. first bought it at costco , they no longer sell this product. the reason for the two stars , half the bag was crushed , could eat it with a spoon.
1	i bought one of these about 4 or 5 months ago - and i love it ! i have kept a combination of rosemary , thyme and parsley. they have all kept fresh for more than 4 weeks ! no brown spots , no rotten leaves - just perfect. i highly recommend this product - no problems with leaks or the plug not holding.
0	i &apos;ve had the other annie &apos;s shells and cheddar and they &apos;re usually very good. i wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier , but it &apos;s really not worth it. it has a different texture that i didn &apos;t like. the flavor was okay but a little bland. if you want a good mac and cheese , stick with the original version from annie &apos;s !
1	i use honey stinger energy chews on all my long distance bike rides. i ride over 100 miles a week and love all the different flavors.
1	i rarely eat anything but whole wheat pasta , but every once in a while , i eat some of this as a treat. almost as good as the pastas that i ate while in italy ! just make sure you don &apos;t over cook.
0	but if you have high blood pressure , skip it ! ! even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels. the licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness.
1	all three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste. peppermint is our favorite. we enjoy a cup after dinner &apos; flavored &apos; with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night. it &apos;s become a tasty habit.
0	the product that i purchased was soggy and greasy like it had been in the sun for awhile. it also tasted like it was rotten meat product. there is no use by or best by date on the package so i do not know how old it is either. i do not recommend this product.
1	this is the best mustard. my husband loves it on his sandwiches for work. it has the right spices and taste to enhance what you are eating. have been looking for it in bigger tubes with not much luck but any size is great.
1	this is by far the best peppered country gravy mix you can buy ! i have tried them all ( almost ) . it is also very diverse in what you can do with it .. add sausage for sausage gravy , chicken broth and chicken for an awesome creamy chicken gravy. same with turkey , ham , etc .. nothing compares to sm &apos;s mixes , unless you make it from scratch and are good at it.
1	i love this product ! so much better than the regular thick rice cakes. they are thin , but very compact , so i use them as a great sandwich bread alternative. they don &apos;t break apart quick as easily as the regular rice cakes. i &apos;ve searched the grocery and health food stores in my area and can &apos;t find this product anywhere. i love that they are now available for subscription through amazon.com.
0	i purchased this product to lure black bear to the bait pile. the product has no sweet smell as one would expect. i have asked for a refund or exchange from the supplier , no response.
1	i was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has. the coffee has a nice aroma and a suddal chocolate flavor. i will get this flavor again.
1	i love belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch. they are really good , and i &apos;m fussy. i haven &apos;t tried them as pancakes yet.
1	we have tried many of the different hot cocoa k-cups ... everything always tasted so watered down , even when using the smallest setting on the machine. however , this brand ... even at the medium cup setting , tasted fantastic. i highly recommend grove square. i haven &apos;t tried any of their other products , but i would be inclined to now based on this cocoa.
0	product was well packed and shipped on time. i put the squid ink in the refrigerator to store. when i went to use it i saw that it expired on 11-11 that two months prior to my purchase date. i was not happy. especially since i visit and shop at the store when i in miami.
1	love these chips , and i don &apos;t even like black beans. very tasty. yum ! ! plus , good for you !
1	what i really like about this selection is the choice of three different hot cocoa chocolates. my favorite is the mint chocolate for it not only tastes like mint chocolate but it has the aroma of a hot mint chocolate. the milk chocolate and dark chocolate are equally flavorful as well. the price through amazon is very reasonable.
1	before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food store. i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy. just one small secret : try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one.
0	unfortunately i am completely disappointed with this product. i have an above-average sense of smell , but this extract has hardly any detectable flavor in the bottle and none whatsoever once added to food. perhaps i received part of a faulty batch ? the seller is letting me return the bottle , but is requiring that i pay for shipping again , so i would be very unlikely to order from them again.
0	i have trouble believing that what is in the package is truly dried fruit. dried poop maybe ? these are downright awful - the smell , the texture , the smell , the taste , oh and did i mention the smell. i have smelled outhouses and mall bathrooms that are more appealing.
1	hooray for an all natural sweetner ! say goodbye to sugar and chemical based sweetners and get your hands on this stevia !
0	horrible &quot; hemical &quot; taste.extremely salty ! ! ! ! ! ! this was a complete waste of money , after the first bag i will have to throw the whole box away ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
0	i admit ordering this online compared to a store is a bit a risky , but this time the box came 5 days after being order with 2 day shipping. the worst part is more than half the chocolate was melted out of the wrappers into the box and all over the remaining chocolate. i would only consider doing this again in the winter months.
0	piece of artificially flavored garbage. good teas are made by celestial seasonings and tazo. not bigelow. it does not taste like raspberry
1	like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste. i &apos;ve tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones. another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out ( though not organic ) , is &apos; africafe pure instant coffee&apos;
1	i was amazed with how fresh these are and there are so many in 1 / 2 a pound. my only suggested would be if you have another person that loves them as much as you do you could split the cost and the beans. i have so many left over beans i &apos;ve been giving them away to grateful coworkers but what goes around comes around so here &apos;s to awesome ingredients !
1	the popchips were excellent - had excellent flavor and low in calories. when you eat these - don &apos;t need another potato chip !
1	these mega lollies are the best i eat 10 a day so they go quickly , i &apos;m not going to tell you how many ive bought since jan. 1 this year. they are great i love them.
1	twinings english breakfast decaffeinated tea was exactly what i was looking for. i loved the english breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version. the taste is great , the price is right , and i &apos;m sold !
0	just plug and play with your preferred software. no hassles , worked great for about 3 months then just stopped working. didn &apos;t drop it ( it is made of a flimsy plastic and is light as a feather - feels cheap ) . it just stopped working. when i buy a product i don &apos;t just want it to work great for three months. totally dissapointed.
1	tiger loves the cat grass .. it only takes about a week after the grass is planted to come up .. so it grows very fast .. i planted it in a pot outside it did very good outside ..
0	the lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water , the only i have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. it &apos;s a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup ! i would not buy anymore of them , unless i can fix the problem ! ! ! ! ! no more disposebale k-cups for me !
1	i love this ricemilk. it has the consistency of almond milk and no soy.
1	same great taste as the honeybush tea bags , but so much more green ! thank you for packaging this in bulk !
0	when habanero is in powder form it doesn &apos;t taste the same nor does it have the same heat. it &apos;s almost physically impossible to get a habanero powder to taste decent. go with habanero flakes instead. they taste better and pack a lot more heat.
1	my brother owns a keurig one cup coffee maker , which is an amazing device. i , however , don &apos;t drink coffee. when i came across these hot cocoa k-cups , i took a chance. they &apos;re incredibly good , and it gives me a chance to share a hot drink with the coffee crowd without having to boil water or milk. this 24-pack is priced well against the coffee k-cups as well.
1	hi , i have to have black tea everyday. i have done it in the past 25 years and it &apos;s a habit of mine. ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea. i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so : )
0	this is soup. very thin , watery and insubstantial. will not order again. there were not even whole lentils in this &quot; broth. &quot;
1	you won &apos;t find a better gluten free pancake mix out there. as a matter of fact , i much prefer these gluten free pancakes to regular pancakes ( and i buy them for my husband ) . i love bisquick for this product !
1	wonderful candy , hard to find. i got a huge bag and put it in freezer. it came shipped nicely in a sturdy box and heavy plastic. just great !
1	i really wasn &apos;t too sure this product would work. it has surpassed all my expectations. i will never buy the ready made k cups again. this is truly a genius product !
1	i &apos;ve reviewed this before - this jerky is fabulous. great salt , great snap , great flavor. so tasty. i want some now.
1	very good corn product , we will be eating this case of corn way faster than we expected. it was well packed and stores in the pantry nicely
1	i usually make my own gluten free stuff from scratch and i love it , but the days when i feel lazy i feel like using a mix , and this one has to be the best one yet. their mix tastes closely like the real ( wheat ) thing. i have made the pancakes , waffles , oven baked chicken , and strawberry shortcakes ... absolutely delicious
1	the tropical punch flavor tastes just like i remember as a kid. easy to use , and fully dissolves in cold water ( although i &apos;ll use a chopstick or knife to stir the mix while the water is filling ) .
1	i gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful jamaica. it has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
1	this hit my sweet cravings perfectly. definitely keeping this around. yum. i would definitely reccomend this to anyone wanting a quick snack that isn &apos;t a lot of calories. get the 94 % fat free and it &apos;s only 100 calories.
1	i bought this product because my dogs were having accidents in the laundry room overnight. i &apos;m not sure how or why this works ... but it stopped them from peeing. the dogs love em too.
0	i was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is. it has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.
1	but if you happen to , like me , there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip i &apos;ve found in this country.
0	these pods are rather bland. i purchased them because i thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. they do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. i would not purchase them again , nor do i recommend them.
1	the pancakes were delicious , but they weren &apos;t as fluffy as the ones i normally make. next time i use this , i &apos;m going to whip the egg whites and see if that helps.
0	i heated these up in the microwave , and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag , and since about 1 / 3 dont cook right , you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. maybe i am not cooking them right , but i followed the directions ...
0	these sprinkles do not taste good at all. especially if you eat what you decorate right after you decorate it. not that impressed
0	wow. the hickory smoked jerkey sticks were incredibly salty. i could not even eat half of the stick. i have had 3 different people try them and they had the same problem. they are so terrible it tastes like you are dumping salt into your mouth. avoid these at all costs.
1	this is a very good gingerbread mix. lots of flavor and easy to make. it &apos;s probably a bit overpriced but i was having alot of difficulty finding any gingerbread mix in the grocery store. i use this mix to make gingerbread muffins with diced pears and dried cranberries. i &apos;ll purchase another six boxes when i run out of mix. a good buy and good product.
0	why do i have to order 2 jars of the same jam ? what if i don &apos;t care for the taste .. then stuck.
0	i have put different treats under each of the yellow covers however , as hard as my dog tries she cant pull the yellow thing out of the hole. i think the holes are too deep making it impossible for a small dog ( she weighs 9 ) to get it out. she was bored with trying after just a few minutes. she was smart enough to know it wasnt coming out.
0	i was disappointed by my first taste of kopali organics chocolate covered dried banana. the chocolate is waxy and the bananas too soft for me. i was expecting more crunch , a drier banana. the banana did not taste of banana to me either. i will not purchase again.
1	i am a mom of 3 kids. with my older two i had such a hard time finding a snack for them that didn &apos;t have so much sodium ! when my 3rd came along , happyfamily introduced happymunchies. i was so thankful to find a snack low in sodium and with a vegetable too ! and to top it off , it is organic so i know it is free of pesticide residue and gmos !
0	this product is grainy and smells very strong. my son didn &apos;t care for it and when i tried it i didn &apos;t either. when i did further research on this product i was disappointed to learn that they use a process that involves hexane to separate the oil used in their &quot; barrel drying &quot; .
1	this brand of coffee is excellent ; you can really taste the flavors unlike many store bought flavored coffees i have tried. i like the individual packets as they stay fresh longer and i just use what i need out of the packet so it lasts a long time. i would highly recommend this coffee ; it &apos;s worth the price ! ! !
1	15 month old loves to eat them on the go ! they seem great for a healthy , quick , and easy snack !
0	dogs loved it , but they freed it and ate it in minutes. turns out to be a dollar a minute for the dogs &apos; enjoyment. might as well have been a milk bone.
1	my husband and both love almonds. i &apos;ve even shared this snack with co-workers and everyone is raving about the good taste of this snack. i &apos;m taking a few bags on our next backpacking trip.
1	i purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee &quot; tea &quot; bags. they &apos;re great because they don &apos;t require refrigeration.
1	well the product was good and the taste is great. the convenience was excellent and the delivery was quick. so what &apos;s not to love ? the darn things tend to clog up my machine. never ever happens with coffee. may one could run hot water after each serving to prevent the clog. otherwise an excellent product.
0	we switched from the advance similac to the organic product thinking it would be better as we prefer organic foods ourselves. it was a disaster with our 2 month old baby getting constipated and progressively worsening her intake till she fell drastically below her calorie intake. we discontinued the product within five days and switched back to the previous similac and she is fine now. her feeding and calorie intake is back to normal
1	this is the best cat food- i introduced it to my 16yr old cat slowly and she is much healthier , has a shiner coat and sheds less. each time i purchase , i switch up the flavors , cats love variety. great product !
0	there is a taste of sugar substitute , the aftertaste turns me off , i &apos;ve even tried using a little bit of milk in the mug before hand to hide the taste. it didn &apos;t , so i &apos;m just using swiss miss powder and a little milk to make it a creamier hot chocolate before using using my keurig.
1	this is an excellent training treat for every day. it &apos;s not a &quot; high value &quot; treat ( used for more challenging training situations ) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive. it &apos;s a good size , though it does make some crumbs. plus , &quot; liver biscotti &quot; is fun to say !
0	i love all things raspberry and chocolate , but this did not do it for me. i don &apos;t like strong coffee and wow is this strong. i only drank one cup out of a box of 48 k-cups.
1	i have missed bisquick since i became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free. i &apos;ve only made pancakes so far , but they are wonderful.
1	this is the best keurig k-cup hot chocolate you can buy. i &apos;ve tried others , but will never buy any other brand again.
1	i can &apos;t believe how wonderful this chip is ! the slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. my family and i are offically addicted.
0	my dog had this mastered in less than 5 minutes. it takes me longer to hide the treat in it than it takes for him to solve the puzzle. pieces made of thin plastic. my dog had more fun chewing on the pieces than looking for the treats.
1	i made cheddar biscuits with this and they came out a little dry the first time , but i adjusted the recipe and they were amazing. i just added a little more milk and another egg. ( we have chickens that lay very small eggs , so 3 of our eggs is like 2 large store bought ones. )
1	if you like oreo &apos;s or the oreo cakester , then you &apos;ve got to try the double stuff cakesters ! ! ! these are the best ! ! side note : shipping was very slow , but maybe your chances will be better.
1	this is terrific honey. what more can one say about it ? there was a great price when i got it , too -- much better than at the local supermarkets.
0	worst popcorn ive ever bought. chewy not fluffy. gave it to the birds for bird food. postage was outrageous ! just not a good experience all around. wont be buying from them ever again.
0	these have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. not pleasant. i would not purchase them again. this the first kcup hot chocolate i &apos;ve tried , i &apos;ll keep looking.
1	i am impressed at how easy these are to use , much better than the one that you can buy from keurig. great company to buy from when i go through these will reorder again
0	i like hot stuff but this thing was a killer. i put a tiny dab of it on a toothpick and was sick the rest of the day.
1	i had a kerig before and it broke. the company said it was because i was using expresso in the k-cup and it was to fine and cloged the machine. kerig does not make a k-cup with spanish coffee so when i found these i was very happy. i have been using these for about a month and i love them and it is so much cheaper. i would highly recommend these.
0	i eat healthy choice most days for lunch and this one is the worst. i no longer buy it. it is flavorless ( unless you add a packet of soy sauce ) . i don &apos;t even think this one will make it into my earthquake food kit.
1	while switch orange is very orangey , it also tastes of something else interesting. it &apos;s fizzy ( but not , in my opinion , excessively so ) and tasty , and i &apos;d consider buying it. i seldom buy or drink soft drinks or sodas ; i just don &apos;t care for all the fizz burning my nose. switch didn &apos;t do that. hurray ! ! !
1	good product and decent shipping. however , the price was $ 15.95 and i later found the same item in a local store for $ 6.95. what a gouge.
0	my pug is , perhaps , too spoiled when it comes to treats. i ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. she turned her nose away. i chopped it and added gravy. she ate the gravy. so i cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product.
1	i have only eaten the raw and they were as expected. i &apos;ll be roasting some up this weekend but i &apos;m always happy with bob &apos;s products. a + company.
1	the citrus flavor is crisp and clear in this carbonated juice. it &apos;s not too sweet , and the bonus of having no added hfcs or sugar is a winner. the carbonation cuts the sweetness in a nice tart balance. it is still high in calories , like any juice is , but i would definitely turn to this beverage over any of the manufactured sodas that contain added sugar , hfcs or preservatives.
1	this is good stuff. however , i planted it , and no cats grew up. just grass.
1	it &apos;s awesome. the dust gave my cake pops a great sparkle to it. i used white and purple candy melts. i would recommend this to anyone.
1	this cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor. it &apos;s moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn &apos;t terribly bad for your diet. it &apos;s delicious !
1	although i had some concerns about product with initial shipment - my concerns were far overshadowed by the excellent , prompt and courteous response from vendor about my concerns. customer service that seems a rarity these days - was absolutely exceptional ! will definitely keep this vendor in mind when i have need for other craft supplies / products.
1	brew it correctly and you really get a beautiful cup of tea. i highly recommend this brand. it is by far the best bagged green tea i have found , and i have tried about all of them. i brew one bag in a 12 oz mug for 2 minutes. absolutely perfect.
1	thankfully i was able to order quite a supply of this gum. my sister and i enjoy this flavor the most and was sad to read it was discontinued. i paid a responable price so , i thank you.
1	great usb audio interface ! i also own the shure x2u and they perform just about the same ... i wish i would have known that before i spent way more on the x2u.
0	i &apos;ve tried other detox teas and this has a weak flavor and color. not impressed , will not purchase again.
1	this ice tea , is like heaven on ice. must try if you love lemon and giger. great price for the content. you can make a pitcher with 4 bags and add some lemon and whatever your sweetner you prefer. great for barbeque parties or a tea with the ladies
0	i found a way that i am able to drink this. make a very , very strong espresso shot and then brew this. it &apos;s not a starbucks white mocha but it &apos;s tolerable until i get through the box. will not re-order.
0	i bought this for my daughter and grandson. they both tried it at different times and they both said it had a funny taste and did not drink it. therefore i will not buy it again.
0	this is a rip off. found out that you can buy this product for under $ 2.00 just about anywhere , not the $ 7.99 they charge. in fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order. do not get rip-off.
0	my kids love these , and we &apos;ve ordered them often - but as was the case with at least one other reviewer , this batch came in with some mold. ( i freeze them as soon as they arrive , so had the have been moldy upon arrival. ) too bad - but at this price , won &apos;t run the risk of having to toss out product.
1	i &apos;ve tried the other gevalia flavors and this is the only one i like ( french vanilla stinks ) &gt; its like your regular cup of coffee that goes with any flavred creamer
1	good product just a little mellow on the pumpkin pie flavor to me. a little sugar on top before you brew picks it a enough though. overall good coffee
0	i love coconut but this bar is a disappointment. the first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better. the problem is that it &apos;s very oily , they put way too much rice syrup and it &apos;s literally juicy with oil when you bite into it. at 246 calories , 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar , this bar is not worth it at all.
1	water based sardines without salt is .... awwfuul. not bad of a product here--far superior to the types i normally purchase at stores.
0	this is a good french roast coffee , although it could be a little bolder. i &apos;ve never before had a k cup dump the contents into my cup. it &apos;s extremely irritating to deal with grounds in the cup and machine when deliberately choosing a system that avoids the mess.
1	this soy sauce is the best we have ever had. thanks to amazon , we were able to find it again. it makes a big difference when using this product. thanks again
0	this are hard and taste horrible - almost stale fresh out of the package. they should be ashamed to compare these to cheetos. i ate 2 of these and throw the rest of the bag away !
1	i purchased the cups , lids and filters. they work exactly how i expected them to work. perfectly ! the lids and cups can be used more than once. the filters unfortunately cannot. i am going to be looking in the future for cups that have the filters attached like in the regular prefilled k-kups. very good product though !
1	over 90 % of dry dog food is very unhealthy and can not even get 1 or 2 stars out of 5 or 6. diamond naturals is a great food. i have 6 afghans and i &apos;ve spent many , many hours of research to find this out.
0	my cat turned up her nose at this , as did my neighbor &apos;s cats when i gave them the rest of the case. don &apos;t buy this ...
1	i &apos;m really glad amazon carries these , they are so much better for you than regular chips and actually taste good too. we haven &apos;t found a flavor we didn &apos;t like yet. i &apos;ll probably use the amazon subscribe feature to get another $ 3 off as we will go through these fairly regularly. awesome chips !
0	this _ was _ my favorite chamomile tea , but they have changed the formula to now include licorice root and vanilla. very disappointed. now i have six packs of a tea that i don &apos;t really want.
1	izze is fantastic. i tried it three days ago , and haven &apos;t been anywhere without a can or bottle of it since. it could quite possibly be the world &apos;s most perfect beverage. nothing artificial , ingredients that you can pronounce , and a taste you just cannot beat. slightly tart and slightly sweet , this light , bubbly drink should be experienced by everyone at least once.
1	i purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. no doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. but i realized this doesn &apos;t have dha that helps to develop cognitive brain function. also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. so i believe it &apos;s a great food for an adult dog , but i wouldn &apos;t recommend it for a puppy.
1	if you want a good quick cooked sauce without excess acidity these are the ones to use. the real san marzano , beware of imitators !
1	this is one of my favorite sauces to have handy. with this order you get two giant bottles which should last a while. the taste of this is perfect ! not for the faint of heart however ...
1	my husband and i love these chips ! personally i think the flavor is perfect. try them for yourself !
1	i love this product. now that the holidaze are falling apon us and i am a diabetic it &apos;s nice to be able to have treats that i can eat , and not feel deprived. this is a great brown sugar sub. it is the best i have tasted it works like regular brn sugar. so if your on a diet or diabetic like me your prayers have been answered.
0	this is a seitan ( wheat protien ) product with a strong anise ( licorice ) flavor that dominates the thai peanut taste. if you like black licorice , you may like this. count me out.
1	i bought this juice because i really like mangoes. it is great refreshing and smooth beverage that everybody in our family enjoy. will buy again.
1	these cups are great. i have been reusing the originals and putting aluminum foil for the top. these make it much easier and you can reuse them also.
1	yuban is one of the best coffees available , but not sold in all areas. amazon &apos;s case price is unbeatable ! ! i get a case every 8 weeks , always on time ! !
1	my two cats love this cat food more than the kirkland signature brand. it &apos;s also very cheap and affordable cat food at walmart. i would recommend this cat food over meow mix or friskies any day. get 9lives dry cat food. it &apos;s one of the better brands out there.
1	i like this coffee. it smells good while brewing and tastes as good as it smells. for a decaf coffee it is very good will definitely buy this at my local store.
1	this is a great oil for baking it gives a nutty flavor. it also works great in dressings much better than olive oil.
1	well worth the price. very large chocolate truffles that taste amazing. can &apos;t wait for amazon to get them again. 1 january 2012. just browsed to the truffle page and had a mini heart attack when i saw the price. they were $ 12.00 when i purchased them in 2011.
1	i have been eating kellogg &apos;s mueslix for years. i love the mix of fruit , almonds , and whole grain. it used to be easy to find but when i couldn &apos;t find it in my local super markets , i was afraid it had been discontinued. when i found it on amazon , i was pretty happy.
1	this is the most delicious soy sauce i have ever tasted. i will surely order it again. such deep flavor.
1	i think sodas are a big waste of money. that said , i had the opportunity to try this and it is divine ! ! !
0	like the other reviewers , i too have had bad luck with this brand of potting soil. i had purchased several bags and repotted a lot of my house plants with it , and all those that i did started having gnat problems within a week. its been very frustrating , they get everywhere but seem to leave my plants that i didn &apos;t repot with this particular potting soil alone.
1	the best , tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass , does not leave an after taste , like a delicate summer breeze in a glass , fresh ice tea anytime of day or night , great for company
1	our cat loves to eat this grass and it was so easy to grow too. i have never been much into growing plants but this was easy and actually useful rather than just grow plants around the house. recommended product.
1	this is delicious bread and i can quickly make up loaves of bread to eat or give away for a special gift.
0	i have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst. instead , i recommend the dove dark chocolate and the russell stover coconut.
1	great product for keurig coffee maker. works fine with coffees and cocoa mixtures. is good for just hot chocolate. like purchase price
0	i had some of this in a sampler pack. it really wasn &apos;t very good. couldn &apos;t taste the hazelnut flavor at all , and it had a bitter aftertaste. would not buy.
0	can i give 0 stars ? this new recipe is so bad that i thought the package expired. it was not until i see it says &quot; new recipe &quot; who approves this crap ? it is terrible .. i had been eating this since i was a kid ( in my 30s now ) and no way will i ever eat it again.
0	i am looking for a replacement for coca cola and i read the positive reviews here and decided to purchase at my local whole foods. there &apos;s a gross stevia aftertaste and it tastes nothing like commercial cola ; it &apos;s not good and it &apos;s misnamed.
1	pop chips are the best chips i &apos;ve had in a long time. i &apos;m a weight watcher and to satisfy that salty craving i get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points. and when i buy a case of them they average i think about .94. not bad.
1	excellent quality and so o o fresh. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000e5ao8o &quot; &gt; bit o &apos; honey candy , 1.7-ounce packets ( pack of 36 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	i don &apos;t eat many chips , but these i love. great buy and arrived quick and packed great. expiration date is a ways away , so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor. i love brown russet , hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee.
1	i &apos;ve used this product in traditional risotto recipes , but it &apos;s also excellent to use in things like chicken soup , makes a nice , creamy , thick soup base. i &apos;m still exploring other ways to use this wonderful product.
0	the low acidity of this coffee is probably a good thing for folks that have trouble with that sort of thing. i found the taste to be lacking and a bit bitter. i brewed it weak and strong and prefered it on the weak side. it &apos;s not a bad tasting coffee just not my cup of ... coffee.
0	my dog refused to eat any of these. i had to give them away. beware if your dog is picky.
0	started out ok , but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn &apos;t like the taste all that much , became picky and wouldn &apos;t finish her feedings. i ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to wellness brand puppy mix. canidae does produce very dense , dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. with a 1-acre fenced yard i don &apos;t bother.
1	out of all of the hot chocolate kcups that i have tried this is by far the best one. not weird aftertaste , and not watered down. tastes amazing and priced fairly , what more could you ask for ?
0	i didn &apos;t like this carbonated juice. although it appears to be all juice ( not artificial flavors ) it tastes somewhat artificial. perhaps it tastes more like canned orange juice ( which tastes nothing like real orange juice ) ! i fully expected to like this as i do like fizzy fruit juice drinks. this one did not do it for me.
1	tasty , slightly different flavors then other brands , but good. in all other respects good purchase. hard to find in us so i am not too picky.
1	i purchased this food on amazon then saw it at babies r us for 30 cents less per jar. i like the product but amazon is overcharging !
0	don &apos;t buy this soil ; it &apos;s full of flying black bugs. check the internet with a search for miracle grow organic potting soil and bugs and you &apos;ll find i &apos;m far from alone. disgusting.
1	i use this syrup in tea , coffee and over cut up fruit and ice cream.i buy unflavored creamer and add this to it. much cheaper alternative to pre-flavored coffee creamer.
1	this saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy. each candy was individually wrapped well. none of the candies were stuck together , which did happen in the expensive version , fralinger &apos;s. would highly recommend this candy ! i served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it !
0	item arrived promptly but was not as described. it did not come with gift box packing and the plant had only 3 blooms and 1 was dead. i requested to return and was told a replacement item would be sent. i has yet to arrive and more than 30 days have elapsed. would not recommend this vendor.
1	i am a true seattle coffee addict , and i have never had a better coffee candy.
0	... i will drink this if all other coffee options are exhausted. the coffee has a vanilla / coconut smell but after a sip or two , i can &apos;t drink it. would not purchase again and i &apos;m having trouble even giving it away. i expected more from wolfgang puck.
1	i enjoyed this water. it was very refreshing. i find i have some stomach sensitivity with some bottled waters. i did not have that problem with this water. nice bottles. water comes from washington.
0	notice they do not give the % chocolate ( like most american brown wax ) . that &apos;s because there is no chocolate to taste. there is no taste at all. it &apos;s wax. it &apos;s a movie prop. not for eating.
1	i thought these had avery good flavor. i took two tubs to work and most of the people liked them. two or three people commented that they liked them better than some other brands because they are not salty.
1	i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries.
0	i like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby &apos;s pancakes. it does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff. it is rather bland in my opinion.
1	i think this is a great green tea powder. i add this powder to a 24oz water bottle and it has a nice light taste , i prefer it unsweeted so that i may add a sweetner if needed. great price for the quantity and the quality of the product.
1	love this brand. great price with save and subscribe. my husband loves them. top with whipped cream in a can and i have a happy man. i wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
0	i guess i am spoiled by my liquid creamers , but these did nothing for me. and i even tried using 4 tablets at a time ! gave them away , and no one remarked that they liked them either. sticking to my fat free liquid creamer for now.
1	these potato chips are excellent.there are no trans fats. they taste absolutely delicious.whenever i am in the mood for potatoe chips , kettles is the brand i buy. a great product that anyone should enjoy and i highly recommend them ! enjoy !
1	i tried this at first as a gluten-free alternative to cream of mushroom soup. turns out its really good ! modified my mils swedish meatballs recipe using this sauce as the base. also served it with shitakes over rice. very versatile and tasty ! and its great that the ingredients don &apos;t read like an industrial compound.
0	we timed it. it took my german shorthaired pointer 1 minute 37 seconds his first go around. pieces slide to easy sot hey will open up with the first wack of the paw. anyone know of anything that actually makes the dog work for a treat ?
0	it may be low acid , but the trade-off isn &apos;t worth it. the odor &amp; the flavor are both poor , and the coffee is relatively weak , which i guess i shouldn &apos;t complain about - if i &apos;m going to drink a cup of foul-tasting liquid , i &apos;d prefer it to be as weak as possible !
0	makes nasty loose poo ! the dry food does the same thing. i &apos;ve tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools.
0	i know the new version is supposed to be better for me , but it isn &apos;t anything for me ( or the company &apos;s profits ) if i will not buy it , as i will not eat it. i actually threw out the box with unused product in it.
1	haven &apos;t had bit o honey since i was a kid ... and seeing them on amazon made the purchase a &quot; no-brainer. &quot; and they were as good as i remember.
1	honeyville rolled oats is a delicious product. i am using them to make a product designed to increase and enrich the milk production in lactating mothers. the oats were shipped to me in a timely fashion and the amazing thing is i only paid $ 4.99 shipping for 50lbs of oats ! i encourage anyone who likes oats to order honeyville rolled oats. their flavor is above all the rest.
1	great thanks for the great service i don &apos;t know what else to say i have said all i have tu say.
0	yuck ... worst &quot; chocolate &quot; i have ever had. save your money on this brand and find another. doesn &apos;t even taste taste like chocolate ; we threw the rest away.
1	product contains 70 % of adult requirement for iron in one tablespoon ; yet is safe and gentle on the digestive system. ordered and sent to my 82 year-old mother who had had some problems with diverticulitis. she took three tablespoons a day for a week then tapered down. she felt stronger in days !
0	i really wanted to like this , as it was organic , and came in a glass bottle , but there was hardly any flavor at all. i could barely smell it , and even when i poured a generous amount on my dish , it imparts little to no truffle flavor / aroma. my truffle salt is much more potent.
1	this is the absolute and complete best beef jerky that i have ever had. you &apos;ll be hard pressed to find better , if you can. it &apos;s tender and has a good bite but at the same time you won &apos;t rip your teeth out either. it &apos;s also not too salty.
1	great gift for all ages ! i purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much , they kept them and would not eat them.
1	this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and i have never tasted better licorice in my life. this product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great. i will purchase another case now.
0	blah ! my baby didn &apos;t like it , then i tasted it and it was awful. it is nothing like what you might expect. it &apos;s like bland goop with a faint hint of unseasoned over-boiled chicken. what , is the theory that we should give our babies nasty food simply to take advantage of the fact that they have nothing to compare it to ? i didn &apos;t even feed it to my dog.
1	these where great couldnt stop eating them. lowest priced anywhere and will buy even more next time. cant say enough about these , they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped also. thank you so much.
1	my husband and i both love this hot chocolate. we are on the auto shipment for every other month and we are going to have to change it to every month !
1	this is delicious. it makes a gourmet cook out of a novice. put it on chicken , pork , steak ... it is ca c &apos;est bon. i wish i could say it in chinese. we love it. we purchase it on amazon prime. saves a trip to the market. makes a wonderful hostess gift.
0	do not buy this if your thinking its only mango. ingredient says &quot; fruit juice blend ( organic white grape juice , organic apple juice and organic pineapple juice from concentrate , organic mango puree. &quot; i cancelled order as soon as i realized this drink had grape and pineapple.
1	want to taste something different ? then you are coming to the right place. i just love the smoothness and flavor of the ranch dressingnow get on your horses ( or mules ) and order some today.
0	looks good , but does not open and close smoothly. the drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track. the tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out.
0	i tried 3 differant brands of this juice because they imply that you would get relief from arthritis pain. save your money and buy tylenol. all of these brands are at best bland tasting and did nothing at all for pain.
1	if you haven &apos;t discovered pop chips yet - you don &apos;t know what you are missing. low calorie and high in flavor. great for the kids lunches. i need the single servings or i will eat the whole big bag.
1	a good drink , about 3 ww points. i mean it &apos;s about what you &apos;d expect from an orange soda- expect it &apos;s all natural , so you recognize the things on the ingredient label. downside- really a lot of calories for such a small can !
1	we go through a lot of dressing and my husband has to have this brand only , so i saw this and said great !
0	i am both a vegan and a chocoholic. these chocolate-covered power bars do not taste as good as they sound. ( my husband won &apos;t eat them at all. ) next time i will find something else when i search &quot; vegan chocolate &quot; on amazon.
0	when i received this product , some of the duck fat had seeped through its packaging. it smelled a bit &quot; off &quot; and the taste was rancid. unfortunately it cannot be returned , so my only recourse is to warn potential buyers.
0	we are disappointed with the great northern popcorn for our new machine. it seems stale ..... and &apos; chewy &apos; . we have a popcorn machine up north and it pops beautifully and tastes like theater popcorn. however , the popcorn we have just received seems old. we &apos;re very disappointed .... and wind up not making popcorn very often.
0	this food is phenomenal but way overpriced. i pay $ 7.99 a case in new york city and it is often on sale for less than $ 6 a case at babiesrus in new york city. grocery prices are obscene in ny so if i am paying less here , this is no deal.
1	i just love these - have tried several flavors .. gives a gluten freer a chance to snack on a crunchy , healthy snack ! !
1	love pop chips ! the assortment package was a great find but would liked to be able to choose the flavor varieties i wanted. did not care for the sea salt and vinegar flavor but all the rest were great !
1	i love these chips and couldn &apos;t contain my happiness when i recieved my box ! ! love them , if you love spicy foods ... get these ! !
1	my cats really love this 9 lives seafood and poultry cat food. they prefer this pate to the slices or chunks. they are a perfect weight and have beautiful shiny coats and lots of energy. it is good quality food and is very fresh.
0	these k-cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made k-cups. i now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the k-cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. i think the material in the disposable k-cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
1	this was a good buy. the variety is still close enough so i didn &apos;t have to worry if baby will like the next one
1	this is a very healthy dog food. good for their digestion. also good for small puppies. my dog eats her required amount at every feeding.
1	if people would read the ingredients they would be less critical of the end product. i only tried them as pancakes and they lent themselves most excellently. i used an erythritol instead of sugar and they tated great and cooked very well. i did not even use a blender to mix.
1	ssssssssssssssh don &apos;t tell anybody ! ! ! more for me ! these are the best snacks ever and i am excited about them because my daughter plays softball and we have snack rotation ... guess what they will be getting ? also for the kids little league , healthy , crunchy and satisfying , just what the little guys need !
0	these are good , though a bit too salty for my taste. but you can get these for about 40 % less at any grocery store. save your money !
0	the picture looks very full and healthy the tree i received was very sparse. no comparison to the real thing. maybe i can grow it to look like the picture , but it isn &apos;t what i thought i was ordering.
1	yay an all natural kids gum . no bht preservative ! no dangerous artificial sweetners . tastes fine and not bad for you !
1	as tasty as the regular ( gluten ) product. only drawback is that you don &apos;t get a lot of mix for your money. half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe. on a good note , it &apos;s nice to have options - by far though , this was the best pancake mix i &apos;ve tried ... and i tried a lot !
1	i used these and a bunch of other colored lollipops for a friend &apos;s birthday and she got a kick out of it. she had been complaining about feeling old so we threw a kid themed party. she had a great time. i don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible to eat one of these spiral lollipops without feeling like a kid !
1	i have been struggling to find them in the shops nearby. much more convenient to order them through amazon ( slightly more expensive , but i save the gas and the burden ) .
1	its a great product.i would recommend this to everyone who wants a tasty sweetner other than sugar.i just started using it , taste so good , the jar is almost finished.
1	this is excellent green tea. it is just a little spicy and very flavorful. green tea is so good for you , you won &apos;t even miss your morning coffee. and ..... you are helping children when you buy tea district children &apos;s tribute tea.
1	we are regular customers for the delicious coffee and purchase the decafe french roast also. it makes a single fresh cup at a time in our flavia coffee maker
0	the prepara herb savor pod is advertised holding asparagus. that was why i purchased it , thinking it would be good for keeping asparagus fresh. in reality the pod will hold very few spears and they would need to be quite thin and short. the ad is misleading. i &apos;ll keep it for storing herbs , but asparagus is out of the question.
0	how can this be &quot; healthy &quot; when it &apos;s made with modified corn starch and high fructose corn syrup ? ick. any &quot; food &quot; that includes meat but needs no refrigeration is not actually food. if the word &quot; healthy &quot; is in the title , it &apos;s probably not. just saying.
1	these are the only crackers that i buy. so healthy and so good. eat them with a salad and you have the perfect lunch.
0	i bought these because i could not find them in any store and had always had them growing up. the price was very high , and the product was stale. not worth the extra effort to get them.
1	my boyfriend and i really like these k cups. we have tried others and they were kind of gross. these are the ones we will stick with. can &apos;t go wrong.
0	i was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. i wasn &apos;t really impressed when my son tried the food. the consistency was way too thin , and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. i would recommend making your own baby food , or use the gerber organic.
1	i eat this pasta every day , without guilt. i love this pasta. i maintain my desired weight without any problem. you have to cook this pasta a little longer than normal pasta , but it is every bit as good.
0	the particular packages had an off taste. however , the seller gave me a complete refund and didn &apos;t even make me send them back. i have ordered this item before and they were fine.
1	i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year.i love them , but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.will be ordering them.
1	the hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. i find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa. the best bang for the buck i have so far found for hot cocoa. i tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
0	thought this is japan made and purchased at almost $ 25 for $ 2 + a pack , i had bought other brands in local stores for a lot cheaper , this is the worst bean thread i had so far. wish i could return it. my experience with amazon is always satisfied except when it came to grocery products. from now on i stop buying food online.
1	i ordered this flaxseed after reading how good ground flaxseed was for you. i ordered a grinder , both were reasonably priced , and the grinding was so easily accomplished. i have been using flaxseed daily since that time , and the claims made on the internet have proven to be true. the product arrived on time and in great shape--i have purchased from this vendor several times , and have not been disappointed.
1	i hope amazon restocks this item always.i can &apos;t stand the other brands out there since it got this brand.and the price is right at amazon to.
1	i absolutely love pop chips as a healthy alternative to regular , fatty chips. the seat salt and pepper and the sour cream and onion are my favorites. i don &apos;t crave regular chips at all !
1	the fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well , i.e. none arrived broken. the cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese ( and not the modern version ) .
1	this tea is awesome. you have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great. little prep time- keeps me going all day.
0	just awful ! i thought food was supposed to taste good ! i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it &apos;s that bad.
0	both of my cats ( age 11 ) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. into the trash they go ( not the cats , the treats ) . not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk.
1	they stopped selling this at walmart which made me sad but then i found it on amazon which made me glad. you have to buy in bulk but ( going by the ones that i received ) they don &apos;t expire for over a year so as long as you store it correctly you should be able to buy in bulk even if it &apos;s a small household like mine.
0	i bought this machine 1 1 / 2 years ago , have trouble with it filling the cup and thought , ok , i might try it again , but after reading a number of reviews and the machine is still having the same problem , i will not purchase another kurig.
0	my husband didn &apos;t care for this coffee at all. he complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
0	this expensive pancake mix tastes so processed and fake. a less expensive bisquick from your local grocery store beats the taste , no doubt. it &apos;s a yucky product.
1	this is a cool kit for gifts , or a great price on a kit of dave &apos;s sauce if you use it at home. a good variety. my only issue is that the bottles do not hold in the wood gift box very well at all , they slide up and down until they fall out of the open spaces in the front or back of the wooden gift box. i would buy again.
0	i agree with the other review , these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt / vinegar combo. unfortunately , every bag i received in that case was over cooked ! they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. they definitely need to improve that !
1	we love these. the cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor. my daughter , age 2 , likes them both , but because we snack on them in the car i opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too. i love that they are healthy and i can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things. love em
1	cavenders makes the best vinegar and oil dressing ever. couple of tbls of cavenders and 1 / 4 vinager and 1 / 4 h2o , rest oil. good !
0	i can &apos;t believe anyone is buying this stuff at amazon ! ! ! go to keurig.com and pay half of this price. spread the word because this is rediculous !
1	i love this tea. it has a very smooth taste and not bitter like other kind of tea. i do agree that the string seems to come apart easily but i can live with that. no big deal ! the quality of tea makes up for that.
1	i like this one better than all the other ones by earths best. the variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all. if i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. it is packaged well and again the variety helps !
1	i bought 4 packets and planted one of them. it only took a couple of days for the sprouts. my cats love it !
1	these small chocolate cups are a specialty party item that i have never been able to find in the past when i wanted them. amazon now provides a link. they can be used for what are commonly called &quot; jello shots , &quot; and provide a solid edible alternative to small paper cups.
1	presentation is yous perfect and product really fresh , tea bags came inside individualized plasticized aluminum bag making them to be ever-fresh. i will buy other kind of teas from this seller , hopefully they must be as excellent as the earl grey one.
1	this is a great product. perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good. also great topping for chicken pot pie.
1	my daughter is very picky , but she like this cookie very much. i haven &apos;t seen any product gfcfefsf this good. great product.
1	super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found. i am glad i found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits ! love it
1	luzianne cajun seasoning is a great way to spice up anything you make. it adds a nice amount of heat to your food without being over-bearing. my whole family loves it !
1	of course they don &apos;t taste quite as good as &quot; regular &quot; brownies but hello ? that &apos;s because they &apos;re healthy ! and that being said , they are fantastic ! why eat crap when there are such good alternatives ! ?
0	we use instant mashed potatoes a lot but these - i &apos;m not sure what these are. the taste is horrible. cannot describe it short of an almost spoiled sour cream taste. off to toss the rest of the packs because they are truly that bad.
1	so surprised to find the taiwan-shaped pineapple cakes , they are so cute ! i &apos;ve never found any pineapple cake like this at our local asian supermarkets , so i ordered some from here. these lovely pastries made our dragon boat festival party much more fun. my friends and i think it is a good idea to order them again for our mid-autumn festival party.
1	this product is delicious ! it is the frappacino mix a lot of independent coffee shops use. you will not be disappointed.
0	i have bought k-cups from amazon before and this was the first time that i bought the van houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. i would suggest that people do not buy these.
1	i used to be a buyer at a natural / organic grocery. this is the best soup i have ever had in a can. i am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is the ritz carlton &apos;s clam chowder. just add butter , milk / cream , and black pepper. have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven.
0	we find consistently that not all the kernels pop but end up being wasted. it is definitely the brand so be forewarned.
0	i have orderred jeremiah &apos;s pick coffee organic breakfast blend whole bean coffee more than 5 times however the last lot i received with really bad quality. lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. hope the seller can check what happen ... i may not try it again.
1	these are the best tasting tortilla chips i have ever had ! i have become allergic to tomatoes , but i love tortilla chips. there is so much flavor in these chips that i no longer miss pico de gallo. i prefer to eat them plain. they also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful , but not overpoweringly spicy.
0	these chips are too salty ! ! ! i like the crunch , size of the bags , and variety. but i cannot finish the case due to how salty these chips are.
1	i bought some of this. creates an awesome effect on decorated cakes and candies. love it ! completely edible. but wayyy overpriced on amazon. usually amazon is cheaper than buying in stores but these are only $ 4 at any craft store so $ 15 is severely overpriced.
0	i bought this cat food at tractor supply. my cats hate this food. they won &apos;t eat it. it is so hard my cat &apos;s have a hard time trying to eat it. my cats are very unhappy with this food. i would not buy again.
0	i purchased this because i read that it was a natural cure for hives .. um , how about not. it did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful. luckily , a co-worker of mine loves this stuff ( reminds him of his grandmother ) and i gave it to him. yucky , yucky stuff.
0	it is not 30oz per can and i find somewhere cheaper later on. i feel kind of disappointed with amazon.com this time.
1	just like anything else from new zealand this food is amazing. my cat can &apos;t wait for it , and plate is always clean. she loves it and i feel great buying ziwipeak. they even put green muscles in this food. overall food looks solid , packed with proteins and kiwi love.
1	some of the best chocolates i ever tasted. if you are a chocolates lover then you have to try these
0	i used the icicle for about two hours. after taking a break , i plug it in and my laptop wont recognize it. i did everything i could think of to fix this , even hours of searching google. nothing. in the process of a return. = / it would &apos;ve been perfect if it just worked.
1	it &apos;s always a pleasure to find french &apos;s products on the web. all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but mccormacks bland and tasteless seasonings. this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find.
1	plocky &apos;s red beans and rice tortilla chips are really tasty. i shared a few bags with my daughter in iraq. she said ummm they are good. they are good for you too. no artificial stuff.
0	i have a yorkie. i only give him a small piece each time. but he throws up every time he eats it. he has never had problems with any other dog food or treats. this treat is terrible. if i could give it 0 star , i would.
0	i ordered 2 cases as always. rvc &apos;d the 2 cases and the crackers were saltless , tastless. amazon was kind to send 2 more cases and they were the same. blah ! i have written the masnufacturer to let them know. amazon has greta customer care.
0	do you really want to be feeding your baby a bottle of corn syrup ? ? ? i used this until i realized that. i switched to gerber , its so much better for your baby.
0	smart and final has 36 8oz for $ 22.50. and remember don`t sign up for the get $ 40.00 if you sign up for a amazon credit card. it`s a rip and the phone will start ringing from the people they sold your phone # tooooooooooo.
0	i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies ! it is not too sweet. i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them.
1	my family loves bisquick pancakes , my kids did not notice the difference from this product and regular pancakes. the only problem is the price , i will try pamelas this week , price seems more reasonable.
1	india tree products are great and you cannot beat the value here at amazon.i use these to decorate cakes and cupcakes. they will get a workout as the holidays near.
0	don &apos;t waste your money on these. these are practically flavorless , yet still feel a little greasy in your mouth. yuck. if you &apos;re looking for some great onion-flavored snacks , just buy the alexia onion strips. they &apos;re light years ahead of these. seriously.
0	busy buddy kibble nibble has been a great toy for my dog , but tug-a-jug was not. within 10 minutes , she had gnawed the &quot; challenge &quot; rope into 6 pieces. maybe it &apos;s good for an older dog but definitely not for my vigorously chewing 8-month-old puppy !
1	this is my very favorite tea of all. i drink it year-round and never get tired of it like i do of others. it &apos;s good any time of the day. not too strong , but still nicely flavorful , with a good balance of minty / spicy / herbal-y.
0	it was awful and didn &apos;t really taste like barbecue sauce at all. it had quite a sour flavor. i actually really enjoy intense flavors of all different kinds of spices but i actually threw this bottle out after trying it. don &apos;t waste your money.
0	i got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely ok , kind of grainy , did not dissolve in milk.
1	very happy with the product .... in a taste test , for the price , it ranks very high. delivery was prompt and as expected.
1	this hot chocolate is much better than other k cup hot chocolates i have tried. it is not watery. i have tried both the milk and dark chocolate version and like them both.
0	just an fyi that &quot; yeast extract &quot; is one of the titles that msg hides behind. msg is a preservative and a dangerous one at that. the package lies ... these contain preservatives. i will not be eating these !
1	imagine if you made a craisin out of a berry that tasted like a lemon instead of cranberry. these are very tart , which i love. i eat whole lemons so tart is fine by me. these are not super sweet either , which is refreshing.
1	while its not traditional satay it is very good the oil is ok cause without it it would be too dry , i had some of these that were a year and a half old i made it and it was fine , i will buy again
0	my son really wanted these as he loves the other flavors. but they are disgusting ! ! ! too much lime : ( so bummed i bought a case and can &apos;t return the unopened 23 we didn &apos;t touch and do not plan on touching.
0	this looks and smells great but my son didn &apos;t really like it. the texture is much lumpier than their other products. it requires a lot of chewing and seems a bit dry.
0	i &apos;m currently eating a very low carb diet. when i saw the mio energy product i was excited to try it. that was until i first tasted it. this stuff is awful. i powered on after first taste and received no energy boost from this mix. i will not use again.
1	great for a snack ( i eat a 2500 calorie / day diet ) ... i eat this between lunch and work and it hits the spot. an entire bowl is 400 calories. arrived on time and its easier and cheaper than buying in bulk at acme or other such ( not costco but i dont have my own member card )
0	product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanuts ... the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as &quot; jumbo &quot; .
0	product is good ; my cats like it. but the price just keeps climbing. i will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.
1	they are everything i expected except for one flaw. i had trouble keeping the lever completely down on the machine.great product and my brother was excited also and i gave him a box. i hope they are in stores soon. such an ease to use , great idea , no clean up just throw away.
0	this candy is not as described. the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described. looks and tastes like it &apos;s way past it &apos;s expiration date. would never reccommend this. paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
1	expensive , but worth it , and ive tried every iced tea out there. lipton is pretty good too , but this is the best ! ! tetleys sux , and many other iced teas like bigelow are terrible , but this is great ! like the coffee shop
0	these aren &apos;t as good as other bars of this type. my kids won &apos;t eat them , nor will my husband. they are all fond of the nutrigrain variety , but i thought these would be a healthier alternative.
0	tuna , as is well documented , absorb and store mercury in fat. anything that eats that fat consumes mercury. i wouldn &apos;t feed tuna to a child , and i &apos;d recommend any adult to read the literature regarding mercury content in seafood. how can it be safely fed to a cat ? regarding this brand of cat food , it &apos;s excellent as long as you feed chicken or turkey.
1	this is a good deal for a flavor not often carried in the stores. the honey berry flaver is a good thing , not being to mediciny and things of that nature. yum
1	i use the powdered tea powder in my fruit smoothies. provides you all the health benefits of green tea. love the product and use both the plain and lemon ginger.
1	i love my garlic spray so much , that i ordered more ! i grow garlic , but i don &apos;t even bother juicing them anymore , not with this product. there are 150 cloves in every bottle. thats a lot of yummy garlic ...
1	i love ahmad tea. the earl grey is a wonderful tea for an afternoon sipping. the bergamot flavour isn &apos;t overpowering like some other brands i have tried. i will be buying more of this wonderful tea
0	the primary ingredient is potato flakes. i guess it &apos;ll fill up your dog , if nothing else. and there is really nothing else. the second primary ingredient is chicken meal. that &apos;s the only source of protein and it &apos;s not even real chicken. just because it &apos;s organic doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s good for your dog. organic low-quality ingredients is still low quality.
1	these are really good. i like to make them with a little extra milk so that they are thin. i can &apos;t even tell the difference between this and regular pancakes. it &apos;s worth the price for my family.
1	these came fresh , and sprout well for me. i am very pleased with them. they make a tasty and nutritious addition to our salads. as usual , amazon delivery and postage was great with the super saving shipping option.
1	smooth. full of flavor. not bitter. no nasty aftertaste. people that like newmans extra bold , starbucks verona and sumatra , tullys french roast and other dark cup should love this. it &apos;s better !
0	i was disappointed - supersweet , but just not flavorful. same thing with the peppermint. will not purchase this brand again.
1	purchased these for our new coffee machine. they work very good. no issues. using these with our regular coffee is a plus.
1	the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives. generally i like to make my own sauce from scratch , but this is my second choice if i am short on time. its taste good and not artificially sweet. i love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste.
0	i received these today ( 4 / 13 / 2010 ) and they are not individually wrapped. i received two gallon type bags , each with 36 raw beef sticks in them. amazon issued refund which i &apos;m grateful for but i &apos;m still very disappointed with product.
0	i enjoy the newman &apos;s own pretzels on a regular basis and decided to start buying them by the case as my local grocery store stopped carrying them. the first two cases i bought from a different distributor were fine , however in the last case i purchased from amazon , all the pretzels tasted stale , although the bags weren &apos;t out of expiration and didn &apos;t appear to be opened. i was very disappointed with this batch.
1	i like the onion garlic flavor. it really tastes good , very fresh and it is much healthier for you than other non organic soy nuts. i like to add them to my salads instead of croutons.
1	a family favorite. these are really unique treats. the wonderful taste of flowers. the violet and rose are great. orange blossom wasn &apos;t to my liking. the company that makes them have been around for hundreds of years. they are made in a small french town that was featured in a movie called &quot; chocolat. &quot;
1	looking for bits as real blueberries seem to have no flavor these days .. these were very good , would def buy again
1	now , i haven &apos;t done a side-by-side comparison , but these chips still taste like the real deal. these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for. portion control and reduced fat ? yes , please ! with the subscribe &amp; save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store.
1	this is a good quality product , which definitely helps tame my tummy. i have it each evening and it makes a huge difference in how i feel. definitely recommended , along with heather &apos;s acacia fiber , which is life-changing.
1	i have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself , it was part of a gift for my daughter in grad school. she likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until christmas ( that remains to be seen ) without having to buy more. a very good snack for a poor grad student
1	my female pixie bob cat , pawnee , is extremely finicky about her canned food. she will touch nothing but instinct &apos;s rabbit formula , and licks her plate clean each morning. the instinct brand is nothing but the best , whether it is a canned formula or dry.
1	they are fabulous and not bad for you , what else could you ask for !
1	we go through pamela &apos;s like crazy. fantastic for pancakes ( we like to add a little vanilla to batter ) . it also makes great chocolate chip cookies and banana bread. the 25 lb bag is definately the best way to go value wise.
1	my westie - like the picture on the package - loves these treats ! they are the perfect size for a treat or reward and even look cute ... we call them &quot; puppy paws &quot; treats ! good texture - no mess ! smell not attractive to humans - but good to a dog !
0	this is the worst flavored coffee i have ever tried. there is no aroma or flavor of chocolate / raspberry to this coffee bean at all. in fact the coffee tastes sour. i too am sorry i couldn &apos;t buy just 1 lb. to try it first -- now i am stuck with this awful coffee i cannot return. so , buyer beware -- no returns !
1	use these as treats for my five labs. use only this type as they contain the ingredients i am looking for and are a great size for labs. ordered them for years. dogs love them.
0	every can was dented , i was so disappointed. it looked like it was packed that way , not that they were damaged in the shipping. i also feel that the pumpkin was a bit on the watery side , so not only will i not order this product through amazon but i will not use this brand again.
0	i bought from amazon in sept 09 for $ 26 , now apri 10 , price is $ 36. maybe time to buy jalapeno stock ? ? ? &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0012272jc &quot; &gt; la victoria hot jalapeno peppers diced , 4-ounce units ( pack of 24 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	i made these according to package directions , and added 1 cup of mini chocolate chips , and they were awesome ! they took longer to cook than the box says , maybe that &apos;s because of the chocolate chips. either way , they were great and i &apos;ll definitely make them again.
1	hands down , the best snack you will ever voraciously consume at a potentially unhealthy pace. it does contain msg , so do be warned , but if that does not dissuade you ( as it would never me ) , give this a shot. this has been a godsend during road trips , movie knights , parties , and general get-togethers of all kinds.
1	this seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish ! if you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning ! can &apos;t beat the price for a top notch product !
1	as processed , mass produced jerkies go , this is one of the best i &apos;ve had. it compares with king-b. i don &apos;t care for all of the poisonous preservatives and processing , but that comes with eating anything these days unless you go and find a hunter you can buy from direct. fresh game jerky would be the next logical step if you can find it.
0	do not order this ! it has absolutely no taste and was completely disappointing ! i tried to return the unopened 5 boxes and amazon would not let me ... total bummer and waste of money.
0	tastes vaguely of bad fish. good idea but it &apos;s a bit off putting. nothing can replace real bacon plus real mayo.
0	these english muffins are okay at best. they are very hard to cut and break apart easily making it hard to toast. they definitely have to have something like jelly or peanut butter spread on them otherwise , do not taste the best.
1	fast , professional transaction. i needed this one ingredient for a new recipe and it turned out great ! now i just need to find more uses for this stuff.
1	for those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store ! i love mccann &apos;s instant oatmeal - all flavors ! ! ! thanks , abby
1	all of the castellana pastas are absolutely wonderful. they have a great taste , hold their unique shapes , grab lots of sauce in your dishes , and have a nice &quot; bite. &quot; this is a great price for this item !
1	i love pop chips and the variety pack was fantastic. delivered quickly - these chips are filling , full of flavor and way healthier than other types of chips.
1	this is one of the best dried organic crackers around. highly recommend them compared to other available types of similar products.
0	i purchased this item on subscription for less than $ 10 and was rudely shocked this month went it went up to $ 16. i &apos;m cancelling. this is ridiculous. cheaper in the store.
1	i love these ! the price is very good ... all the flavors are really good ! the peppermint one is my favorite and i would gladly take more of that before the others. though the others aren &apos;t lacking at all , i &apos;m just a peppermint fan ! will be buying more when my others get low ! thanks so much !
1	this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride. i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor ... no after-taste and i actually like the slight carbonation. i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line.
0	like the other reviewer said , this pepper doesn &apos;t have much kick - if any at all. i had a feeling something may have been off - or in this case , nonexistent - and that certainly is the heat. don &apos;t waste your money on this stuff !
1	reed &apos;s crystallized ginger is the real deal ! it &apos;s natural and basically just ginger with sugar. 1 piece takes care of my candy cravings and aids my digestion of lunch etc.
0	after following the directions to the t i was completely unable to stomach this product. it was a little crunchy and very jelly-like. this was just a huge waste of money for me and very disappointing because i was really excited to think i had found such a low calorie substitute for regular pasta.
0	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001aj1uls &quot; &gt; dogswell happy hips for dogs , chicken breast , 15-ounce pouches ( pack of 3 ) &lt; / a &gt; dogswell chicken jerky is now made in china. the fda has warned against dog food products made in china. don &apos;t risk it !
0	ok , i read the awful reviews but i am such a chestnut lover that i knew i would not have a problem. this product looks like a chestnut. but the taste and texture is awful and i gagged. it should not be allowed for sale. do not buy !
1	got three different amish popcorn &apos;s for my daughter &apos;s birthday .. she is always on a diet , i got her the hot air popper same time ... she &amp; my grandson .. ( he &apos;s 4 ) loved it .. she ate a bowl every night &amp; still lost 15 lbs ! ! not saying it &apos;s a diet food , just satisfiing ! !
1	i like creme brulee. i loved that these were so easy. just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. they look amazing and taste great. my guess thought i really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. i will be ordering more !
1	a very tasty little cake. the cake was surprisingly moist , and the caramel rum sauce was very sweet but not too overpowering. we &apos;ll definitely be buying this product again.
1	these are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy , perfect with dips or salsa. tastes just like rice cake. they are very easy on the teeth too , for those who have dental work that they don &apos;t want to chip. hard to find in supermarkets.
0	recently purchased this cereal assuming it would contain nothing but healthy ingredients , then i read the label and discovered it contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup.
0	way to expensive and there are so many other options. it is even more expensive if you buy from purity products. too bad they charge so much.
0	this tea didn &apos;t do anything , steal have issues with itching throat , ear and everything else. but i do enjoy the smell of it .. ill say it last up to a few hours and that &apos;s it.
0	this tea just doesn &apos;t really taste or smell like chocolate strawberry. it &apos;s just kinda &quot; meh &quot; and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s worth the price.
1	this has great flavor , but i am not sure it would be a soda alternate. i am thinking it would be good for a lunch or mini fridge at work ! tastes great , but i really did not get the carbonation kick i get from a soda.
1	i love the taste of this coffee. it does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can , which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can , keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air.
1	these chips are good to sprinkle on salad , use in cookies and baking and sprinkle on cereal. very pleased.
0	this was not good. the flavor was lacking and barely came through unlike the hint water -- which i really enjoy. i wanted this to be good and was so excited to get it but it just disappointed.
0	what a rip-off. these chocolate bars can be found in the dollar aisle of many grocery stores. they are also found in some 99-cent stores. don &apos;t be fooled into paying $ 8.94 ( including shipping ) for a $ 1.00 chocolate bar !
0	my dog does not touch this stuff. the paste is messy and not something you would let your puppy play with in the house. i did try freezing the kong toy but as soon as the paste thaws it oozes out of the toy and creates a huge mess. he does like the kong toy without the paste.
1	i have never had a problem with anything from amazon. i have ordered about 30 cases of earth &apos;s best baby food. this is the most tasty and nutritious variety they offer. 5 grams of protein , and 15 % iron ! i have it on my subscribe and save. he can &apos;t get enough of this , he eats it everyday !
1	these individually wrapped pieces are delicious ( although i wish there were a few more ) . mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste , even a traditional &quot; marzipan-aholic &quot; should enjoy these.
1	these are the best chips invented for those who are trying to watch their calorie intake. you get a lot of chips for minimal calories , and they taste great ! !
1	i liked the idea of the small popcorn. it pops up really well in the popper but it doesn &apos;t have much if any &quot; popcorn &quot; flavor. was pretty bummed by that.
1	i have been drinking tully &apos;s kona for the past 2 years , but with the price increase of kona , i needed to find something less expensive. after trying numerous kcups , this mahogany is just as good as the kona , with a full coffee flavor , and a hint of caramel. i am happily converted.
1	i &apos;ve purchased a few of these , and they are very reliable. i &apos;ve used them with win7 and os x. the a / d quality is acceptable for most needs. the limited bit depth and sample rate are probably the only drawbacks.
0	i returned them , they made my dogs sick ( diarrhea ) . they used to eat them all the time. guess their stomachs couldn &apos;t handle it as they got older.
0	cute , inexpensive litter mat. however , the side curled up and will not flatten down , plus it will not stay in place on our linoleum floor.
0	darn these taste good , but do they * really * have to make them with insects ? should be avoided by vegans , vegetarians , persons with religious diets that restrict insect consumption , and people with insect allergies.
1	i buy most of my flours from bob &apos;s red mill in the 4-pack boxes , if only because having all the bags and boxes the same size makes it easier to store them. it &apos;s good flour , and the bag &apos;s a good size for baking for a small family - also a good shape that will stand up on the counter while you scoop flour out of it.
1	this gravy mix is excellent ... except , don &apos;t use water where called for , use milk instead , and it makes it 100 % better ! !
1	these are great little snack packs - flavorful chips and fairly low fat and low cal.
0	not a big fan. will not buy this again. plus she eats it really quick too , other than the throw up part.
0	bottom line , this made my cat projectile vomit. i &apos;ve never had a problem with him eating friskies before but , i knew &quot; cheezy craze &quot; just didn &apos;t sound right. it came as a sample in one of the larger bags. not fun to clean up after partial digestion.
0	these clams are not whole and the flavor is very fishy. the chilean &quot; geomar &quot; brand is much better and they are &quot; whole &quot; .
1	wonderful ! my son loves these granola bars ! he has celiac and we wanted to try something different , these were a hit !
0	i did not know anything about chutney until i went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar ! i thought chutney was a different form of marmalade but i was wrong !
0	someone at work cooked these and the smell is now making everyone sick. smells kinda like puke. hopefully the smell does not last overnight. not recommended.
0	this is one of the worse tasting soups i &apos;ve ever eaten. i hated it , and now i have a full case. it tastes bitter to me , and my husband wouldn &apos;t even try it. only my cat was trying to reach it on the counter !
0	i am a true lover of hot chocolate and this chocolate is not that great. the taste is flat and does not taste that chocolaty. i was truly disaapointed so i shared it with a co-worker and she stated that she did not like it either. her exact words were , &quot; this has a unusual taste ... not good &quot; .
1	my 7 mo old despises all things fruit-related ( we think it &apos;s too sweet for her ) yet she likes this one just fine ! i &apos;m perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it , although i must admit i haven &apos;t tasted it myself. for us it &apos;s a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day.
1	there is nothing wrong with this product , but it is overpriced. with a little research you can buy this for less than half the price. buyer beware
0	the individual pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.
0	the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions. i know how i normally cook couscous so tried 3 / 4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit , covered for 5min. it was mushy and tasteless.we have thrown out the rest of the container.
0	was looking forward to this. what a disapointment. it was stale. i didn &apos;t even try to return because i was just that fed up and looked at it as a lesson learned. trust you me this is not the first food item i ordered on line nor was it the first stale one. lesson learned is don &apos;t buy food on line anymore.
1	i tried thhis popcorn in a the presto poplite air popcorn machine. the instructions were easy and the results were very gratifying. i added sea salt and a little olive oil. the measuring container made 5 quarts. i just couldn &apos;t stop eating it. simply delicious.
1	this is the best caribou kcup if you like a dark , hearty roast with good flavor and little acidity. will definitely buy again.
1	perfect mid morning snack for someone like me who is currently doing a meal replacement drink for breakfast. one of these and piece of fruit is just what you need to get you to through to lunch.
1	this is a simple salad seasoning , just add vinegar and oil one packet of goya salad seasoning and you will have the best salad ever. also you can put in a potato salad and is marvelous also ! please give it a try and enjoy it ! ! !
0	can &apos;t drink this , have an allergy to both dairy &amp; soy products ! make it a true dairy and soy free product then i could buy and consume it !
1	works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush. can not find decaf in stores. can add other flavors and spices to taste. good for nutrition builder.
1	this is the absolute best gum flavor ever. it really tastes like key lime pie and the flavor lasts a long time. yummy !
1	granda po &apos;s are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious. they are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt-free. i love all the flavors. my son begs me for them , so now he &apos;s a fan too. i even shipped them to my brother &apos;s platoon in iraq. everyone loved them !
0	very difficult to work with - tends to turn to solid rock even when following directions - taste is less than desirable
1	we &apos;ve originally bought this as our dog &apos;s first food and then switched to wellness. dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to newman &apos;s own and now our dog feels a lot better. never switched his food ever again.
0	the number one ingredient is chicken ... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn &apos;t eat yourself. i will stick to natural balance which is sold here on amazon as well.
0	i ordered because of the great price .... but yuck the stock is stale . tastes like old iced ted left in the fridge toooo long. not my first yogi tea flavor and not my first box of detox , so know it is not supposed to taste like this. worst part that is the one i ordered the most of : } others seem fine so far : }
1	was exactly what i was looking for. super fast shipping ! a bit on the spicy side , but great taste ! ! ! ! would definately purchase them again !
1	i loved this product for fruits and other food that i didn &apos;t want my new baby to choke on. i also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething. it worked great for this , as well as for the food. i didn &apos;t like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean !
1	this is a great company. and the first i have ever seen to offer a low acid option. you can absolutely taste the difference. it &apos;s coffee without the bitterness. makes it possible to enjoy the purity of the bean without the bitter taste. they also have very cool black mugs. love them !
1	i got these beans based on the good reviews and wasn &apos;t disappointed. i also got 70 beans in my pouch , nice moist and supple pods that will make a gallon of vanilla extract. great beans for a great price ! ! !
1	what can i say - they just work. no muss no fuss. fill the cup pop the top on and save money.
0	all the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these ... i wish i hadn &apos;t : ( it &apos;s been two months since i purchased them and i still have four out of the six containers unopened. they &apos;re just blah. now the chili lime flavored almonds from blue diamond , on the other hand , are mmm mmm good !
1	i buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine. light , flavorful , and full of vitamins , these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. i am vegan so i use egg substitutes ( 3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 tbs water ) and they still bake perfectly.
1	i bought these for the office and no one can put them down. i &apos;m ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. didn &apos;t have to shop for them either , amazon brought it to my door !
1	we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy. they taste fine for our family- we like them many ways !
1	these are a delicious guilt free snack that i always have handy. they are so convenient and last a long time. i also get the corn and mixed veggies which are also wonderful. you can get them at whole foods but not at this price.
1	i bought these as a gift for my sister , i was so excited to see that they arrived in great condition. my sister loved them !
0	after making several batches using different techniques i can only get 50 % of the kernels to pop. i used a different brand of kernels with much better results. the only conclusion i can come to is that these packages are stale. it doesn &apos;t help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages. i would recommend to not buy this product.
0	certainly does not taste like bacon , but is good on a cold turkey sandwich. if you are looking for a smoked flavor spead this is the spread for you. wouldn &apos;t every buy it again.
1	i am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories. these crackers are good , not in a &quot; omg &quot; type of good , but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that i can &apos;t really explain. i would definately recommend them. everyone i give them to keeps asking me for more. i guess i should stop sharing.
1	i love this product ! it is the best natural sweetener i have ever tried , and i have tried many. you can use also as pancake syrup or as a substitute for honey on your peanut butter and honey sandwich. it last a long time , and is a good value.
0	price was misleading , once the high shipping rate was added , the tea was no longer the &apos; deal &apos; it was promoted to be. although once it finally arrived , it was half decent tea , but not worth the shipping and the wait , will go to my local tea house next time.
0	two words : potato flakes. not sure what the buzz about these is. try one bag before you buy a case. can &apos;t be returned.
0	someone gave me the jar of pb2. i thought it was awful ... yuck. thank goodness i didn &apos;t actually pay money for it. it was nasty ! !
0	unfortunately , this product was not enjoyable. i &apos;ve been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce , but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin. it leaves a starchy almost gritty aftertaste / texture. my only positive comment is that none of the cans were dented.
0	i bought a big pack of this gum. the flavor ( kiwi watermelon ) is ok , but it didn &apos;t last long , i found i would usually pop a new piece in my mouth after about 2-3 minutes to get another shot of flavor. i wouldn &apos;t really recommend this gum , it &apos;s not horrible , but not that great either.
1	handy cups were easy to fill using the enclosed stand and performed quite well. lids fit snugly and ran well through my keurig machine.
1	i really liked the taste. it is well priced too. it is a great and healthy alternative to table salt. i even used it on salad.
0	i recently ordered the 16 oz. , 3 pack. when my fedex order arrived on december 26 , 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order. i would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1 / 3 of my $ 105 charged price.
0	this stuff is ok as far as clumping goes but it has such a strong perfume odor that i will never get it again.
1	i must be in love if i &apos;m mulling over a 12 pack of big bags for myself. i love the crunch , intense curry flavor , seediness , and the fact they are gluten free. these are one of the more original savory snacks you can find. they &apos;re very hard so you need good teeth and i love the substantial curry flavor that is not &quot; kind of indian &quot; tasting.
1	the chips are very good and serve as a great snack with very low calories and weight watcher point value.
1	it took a couple of tries to figure out how to snap on the cap and a couple of tries to tell how much coffee to put in it for the strength preferred. after that , it is economical and not much trouble.
1	if you are a peanut lover , these are for you. much larger than cocktail peanuts. six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year ! !
1	no bitterness. a strong , full-bodied , cup but does not taste like ashes. smooth , very drinkable. if you like bold , dark coffee , this will please.
0	i did not know that i was ordering biscuit crumbs. that is exactly what i received. such a lousy product. it &apos;s amazon &apos;s fault for shipping out expires products. will never order food from amazon.com ever.
1	this item is so hard to find. i was so thrilled to find i could buy more than just one at a time.
0	i found this coffee weak and not very appealing. the vanilla flavor is hardly present , and when you do get a taste , it is artificial.
0	very disappointed , not much pumpkin or spice , just pretty close to plain old coffee. i was hoping for something like they have at tim horton &apos;s but its not even close.
1	i loved this tea ! it is refreshing and delicious with or without sweetener. a great buy ! i would definitely recommend this product !
1	i love chi chi &apos;s corn cake and i love that i can purchase it from amazon. my local grocery store stopped carrying it and i was so happy to see that i could order it from amazon. i would give it 5 stars but not everyone in my family loves it. ( i don &apos;t know why , it is so yummy ) it is a delicious side to any mexican meal !
1	i &apos;ve been trying different beef jerkeys and by far i find this product to be the best tasting. nice meaty chunks and very flavorful.
0	not good , product was old and nearly passed due , poor quality and taste when compared to a fresh product. the product seemed dry and the taste was inconsistent with previously purchased , fresher products.
1	we have two westies who , to say the least , have very sensitive digestion systems. since using this product , their hair is soft and moisturized , they love their food , and to boot , they are down to their recommended weight. we &apos;re on the automatic delivery program and that &apos;s the best no brainer ever.
0	i love ostrim natural flavor and used to buy it at local deli and / or gnc , decided to buy on amazon to save money. but this one taste dry and old , like its past its expiration date or something. i was looking for the expiration date on the box and found none
0	the product came at the end of august with expiration date of 01 / 07. as a result i could not eat it. just waist of money
1	popchips are phenomenal ! unfortunately , just not readily available at a retailer near you. ordering online is the next best , especially with amazon prime service ! my dad loved his boxes of popchips. i &apos;m happy , as his daughter , to find a healthier snack that he can enjoy and receive right at his doorstep.
0	this is for the regular flavor ... i give it zero starts , it was so bad. hard to believe this is food , and really hard to believe all of the good reviews. i felt like i was eating packing material , and it left a slimy , yucky residue in my mouth. totally disgusting. bbq stix are way better !
0	coffee tasted bitter and burnt. didn &apos;t like the 1st cup ; kept open mind ; 2nd cup not any better. wish i could return the remaining 48 cups. one star for fast shipment.
1	service was great , but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade : ) love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade
1	without beating it to death - if you like a full bodied , but mellow brew this might be for you. it is hearty , but not at all bitter. it holds a nice full body , even when the keurig is set to the oversize setting. it &apos;s now my favorite blend.
0	these things are like eating poker chips with seasoning salt. they &apos;re remarkably high in calories , too !
1	this brand of granola bars are really good. the very berry are my favorite. however , the bars are almost ridiculously small. yeah , we &apos;re gluten free , so our food is a lot more dense than other food , but honestly , can we not have normal sized , good tasting granola bars ? they really are tiny. so , the taste is great but the bar is small.
1	we love these chips. they can be eaten alone , since they are so crisp and tasty or with a dip. every one that we have introduced the chips to , loves them. and the expiration date is for 8 months from now , so ordering 12 bags didn &apos;t come near to them going stale.
1	these chips taste awesome. and unlike most other flavored chips , they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip. just don &apos;t pass gas near any pretty ladies after consumption. they &apos;ll totally know it was you.
1	my son is only 9mo , so he can &apos;t say it yet , but he loves these. he gets excited when i even take them out of the pantry ! ! i like the fact that they are organic and also have carrots.
1	popchips are a healthy and light alternative to regular potato chips. they are full of flavor , and only 2 weight watcher points per delicious bag ! i have shared these chips with family and friends , and they are all now fans ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001rvfdoo &quot; &gt; popchips 6-flavor variety pack , 0.8-ounce single serve bags ( pack of 24 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	i have ordered these cookies many times .... normally love them ! ! ! but the last two times i &apos;ve bought them , they have been stale.
1	i use this on my oatmeal every morning. i can &apos;t tell the difference between this and brown sugar. no &apos; after taste &apos; .
1	this is for all the beef jerky lovers out there. if you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that ive found anywhere. all of the flavors are great. the black peppered in my opinion is the best and the wood smoked is a little dry but still good. i would recommend it to anybody.
1	everyone who has tried this that i know absolutely loves it. there isn &apos;t a lot of heat , but for me that is fine. the flavor is spot on and reminds me of the old fire crackers ( before they changed the recipe to dry sticks of meat probably made of orphan kids ) . i &apos;ll definitely will be buying this again. only downfall is the stupid shipping costs ...
0	this bone was dry and crusted and so small ! it was purchased for a 50lb dog and is more suited in size for a 5 lb dog ! will not buy again !
1	this seems to be the best brand that i have tried. others have been very weak in flavor , but not htis one. i would truly recommend this for moms who have small children and need the hot chocolate after playing in the snow. grab the marshmellows and enjoy ! grammie smith ( 6 grandkids )
0	consider purchasing a different product , this juice is contained in plastic # 7 , one known for bpa and is widely told to avoid , especially for babies ! ! !
1	sweet , juicy and yummy. i have to try hard not to eat too much at one time. so addictive. it tastes just like those in asian market. actually this one tastes a bit better.
1	i like this bread , and several other flavors in this brand. this one and the seven grain are my favorites. they bake consistently well in my wolfgang puck machine. recommended !
1	i am fairly certain this is the same tea sold by caribou coffee. i think i could be considered an addict ! the flavor is so good - lots of cinnamon and slightly spicy because of it. price for 50 is good and less than i have been able to find it elsewhere.
1	if used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack.
1	who doesn &apos;t like vegetables that are portable and at a great price ? can &apos;t beat the convenience at about 4 cents per package !
0	i really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews. i am not a cheese snob. i like baked lays with cheddar flavor. but something in the flavor of these cheddar popchips is not right. the first bite is ok but then there is a bitter aftertaste. too bad. back to lays !
1	i had read another review and the reviewer was concerned about this product coming from china. i called the manufacturer and was told this product is made here in the us. my dog loves them ! !
0	read the ingredients. fd &amp; c red # 40. no where does it say rice vinegar. i wouldn &apos;t serve this to hitler. another chinese ripoff
0	i won &apos;t say watery , but much thinner than every other honey i have ever eaten. good news , no waiting for honey to travel to top of jar ! it just runs right out !
0	they may have great products , but shipping is incredibly slow ( shipped 12 days after i placed the order ; not yet received ) and the shipping price is unreasonable.
0	i felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties ... too bad none of the would eat it , no matter what i did. donated it to the local spca -- maybe a dog will eat it.
1	these taste wonderful ! guilt free if you can stop at one bag. will definitly buy again !
0	it was bad before we open them. i saw them when we got. i did open. it had some spot green color. i did not know what it was. i was very upset. do not buy this product.
0	so i bought this to use with my 750ml torani syrup because the description states it &apos;s a universal fit for these bottles. however , the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. i ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. the price was cheap so i didn &apos;t feel like returning it.
1	got this item on a one-day-only sale on amazon. love having the single-serving portion as i am following ww plan. only 3 points plus per serving. tasty and on the same line as the special k crackers. the variety is nice to have and the box will last for awhile. cheddar and bbq are my favorites. try them ...
0	they kept raising the price. the product was great and remained the same but they kept raising the price. this last order i have had enough and will be going back !
1	perfect size can and a refreshing drink. i think it &apos;s proof that simple is best. this would be my first choice for a drink if i were out and about.
1	love the product ! i can now custom blend my personal favorite coffee blends , and get them cheaper than buying pre-fab k-cups !
0	these sardines are okay , nothing more. don &apos;t fall for it. at $ 2.82 a tin plus shipping , the bela sardine from portugal blows these out of the water. you can purchase belas for $ 2.45 a tin and maybe less if you find them sold in bulk. what am i going to do with 11 more tins of a so-so sardine. ugh !
1	i love panang curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it. so decided to try making my own , and with this product , i get exactly what i want , hot tasty panang curry adding lots of fresh veggies , tofu and brown rice. and it &apos;s very hot , didn &apos;t have to add any spices at all. great product , will purchase again.
1	i ordered for my dad for fathers day and he ate the whole box within two days. he said it tasted really good , now i want to order some for myself , haha.
1	i though it was fresh , moist ; however , personally alittle to sweet for me. i think i`ll stick with the john wayne brand. jw brand is more expensive but it seems to soot my taste buds better.
1	this is a very good snack that i feel great about offering my 10 month old. she can easily pick up the small pieces and definitely enjoys the apple cinnamon taste. my 5 year old loves them as well ! i would definitely recommend these to anyone with small ( or larger ) kids. : )
0	this is basically seasoned paste in plastic tube. it does not cook well on it &apos;s own and is only good as an extra flavoring. the taste seemed a bit weird to me. it tasted like plastic. gross ! ! save your money and just get some good quality spices to add to your meal.
0	the taste is bitter , the smell is atrocious , and they are not naturally smoked. &quot; aqueous natural smoke &quot; is a chemical stew injected into the fish. for anyone thinking these are the real thing , all i can say is &apos; there is a sucker born every minute.&apos;
0	i found this too sweet. am hoping there &apos;s an unsweetened version available. not very chocolatey too , kinda like swiss miss.
1	i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them.
1	this hot chocolate is very good and flavorful. compared to other hot chocolate that we have tried it is cheaper and we would recommend.
1	just an outstanding product an authentic dulce de leche ranked number-one in argentina for its exceptional richness and depth of flavor. made at a small dairy outside of buenos aires. ( note that the web page or supplier indicates &quot; made in spain &quot; but this product is clearly made in argentina )
1	an excellent , bold , medium blend of decaf coffee for a special evening. dark enough without being bitter and a perfect compliment for a light desert !
0	the container itself is very strong , but our 40 lb springer spaniel chewed the rope apart in less than 15 minutes so she could get all of the treats.
1	very satisfied with this product ; excellent flavor and texture ; recomment for those looking for good breakfast choice
0	cookies were not real fresh , and they were not quite stale. somewhere in between. cannot say that they were appetizing. filling had crumbs all over. nice sized package for lunch though. delivered on time with no damage.
0	they package their product in plastic containers while boiling hot. does &quot; organic &quot; make sense after that ?
1	these seeds are awesome , good size with the perfect amount of spice.buffalo to ranch flavoring. i &apos;ve only been able to find them here locally at 2 or 3 other gas stations , ordering them via amazon is obviously cheaper and saves me nearly 4-5 dollars buying the box.
1	i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this. but out of the can ready mix with a little salt , pepper , spinach , and some cheese and it &apos;s a great easy meal !
1	heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast. an avid hiker , i have used other energy gels with limited success. taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb , they provide the extra boost you need. the chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy. highly recommended.
1	i &apos;ve tried a few other mixes for pancakes , and they &apos;ve been awful , but this one is really good. i should buy stock in the co. , because people will be buying this product i &apos;m sure.
1	sojos foods have been tested for nutritional content and they are all formulated to have a calcium to phosphorus ratio of 1.4 : 1. you do not need to add calcium or phosphorus.
0	ingredient list : sugar , acidity regulator ( including miscellaneous chemicals ) . no tea whatsoever. $ 22 for 18 oz. ( 500g ) of sugar with apple flavor. most expensive sugar in the market ! ! health benefit ? none ! it comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. that &apos;s all. nothing more.
1	best coffee in the world. when you open a can and sniff ---- ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ! can &apos;t go wrong with yuban.
0	the first time i filled it , it droped on my hard floor and the bottom shattered. my doggie didn &apos;t even get a chance to try it out !
1	i had tried a small batch of the pods for my keurig and fell in love .... this fog chaser variety is just about perfect. i shall be ordering more beans so i never run out.
1	this cereal is the best cereal on the market. it has many flavors , including nuts , raisins , dates , and especially a light malt flavor. i have enjoyed it most mornings for years.
1	i am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for keurig. previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so , but this is definitely better. the variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest. i never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over. move over coffee lovers , we cocoa drinkers have found a home !
1	despite what many say and think about bulldogs , ours are picky about their snacks. they love the liver biscotti which can be a hand-fed treat or used in a treat ball. they last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don &apos;t often chew their food , these are the perfect size. i don &apos;t feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.
1	this is a great hot cocoa as long as you read the box and only use the 8oz setting on your coffee make. otherwise it will taste watered down. also it is an instant coffee so dont be surprised by it.
1	my pug absolutely adores these treats and will do anything for one. i can get anything away from her and get her to go anywhere. they are a big help for me and a wonderful treat for her.
1	these chips are great substitute for the usual high calorie ones offered ! i keep them on hand to aid in my weight loss venture.
1	if you &apos;re looking at this you probably already know you like these chips. this is a great deal and i have not had any problems with them going stale. the 1oz bags are a great size for a snack and help avoid over-eating.
0	not my taste. if you like it spicey , you &apos;ll probably like it. me , i like my earl gray. i &apos;m old fashioned like that.
0	this coffee may be low acid , but it leaves such an awful after-taste - like you &apos;re drinking burnt coffee grounds. this coffee was so bad that i poured it out and made a fresh pot of what we &apos;ve been drinking. world of difference !
0	everyone of the cans were severely dented and all of the dented sides were carefully placed so could not see them. the cans were shrink-wrapped and packed in plastic air bags , there was no damage to the box they arrived in , so they were dented when packed.
0	arrived on time , all that is well , but did not taste good ! i mean it &apos;s quick , microwaveable , etc. , but the taste was off and i couldn &apos;t even finish the pack of 6.
1	i love earth &apos;s best. my son eats almost all of the earth &apos;s best single and combination foods. this pack in particular has two of his dinner / lunch favorites : summer vegetable and brown rice and lentil. some of the dinners and a lot of the first purees are very runny so we mix with some cereal to thicken.
1	the maxwell house international coffee - vanilla nut cafe - is absolutely my favorite flavor ! seems to be extremely difficult to locate now , though. last purchase was made through amazon and hoping it will become available again soon !
1	nothing gritty and second rate here ! they are just as good and the only pancake mix we use for the whole family , gluten free or not ! they are that good ! !
0	bahlsen butter cookies , 4.4-ounce boxes ( pack of 12 ) very disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing , there is no mention of eggs and when i received the product , on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is egg. also i emailed not send me any cookie with eggs
0	too salty -- enough said. i order the wood smoked 30-count jar. remember , the price is for only one jar ( not two ) .
1	i just got these and my dogs love them , they smell pretty good and their breath is a little better smelling. they are excited when i open the treat jar and they see these yummy treats. i like them for the low calorie and better breath ~
1	loved the assortment pack. everyone in family loves them. low fat , lower calorie and all natural , simple snack for kid &apos;s lunch bags. it is peanut and tree nut free ( safe for allergy kids ) and although it is made on equipment shared with wheat , i bought this for my child who is on an wheat limiting diet.
0	i expected this product to be similar to those sold by mrs. may &apos;s. what a disappointment ! they are very salty. imagine taste combination of salt and sugar. the bag is going back to costco. i would not eat another piece , even if it is free.
0	this is simply a mix of brown sugar and splenda , i am sure it would be cheaper to make your own
1	again , exactly what i ordered. no fuss , no muss. arrived on time. pretty much an ideal transaction. only thing that threw me was that i underestimated the quantity. ( gallon baggie in the freezer , ftw )
0	i received this box of popcorn and &quot; stale &quot; is an understatement. the seller has a non return policy and i can &apos;t email them either. don &apos;t waste your money rip off popcorn is stale and there is a &quot; non-return &quot; policy
1	i had used and come to love this product and suddenly could not find it in stores near me. i came to amazon and there it was ! i could not get my card out quick enough ! i share with my daughter who also can &apos;t find this item locally. thanks amazon ! ! ! !
1	dried berries , still with texture and the quintessential aroma. pot roast is so much better with half a dozen berries flattened into the breadboard and scooped into the pickling mixture. but in ten years , trying to find them - gee. so now i know to look for it on amazon.
0	2 boxes of truffles i had to throw away. they tasted old , stale and had been melted and recooled probably several times by the way they looked.
0	this product was absolutely horrible ! each and every bar was obviously old , because it was stale , smelled awful , and had to be thrown out. shame one you for even trying to sell such a product !
1	unless you can use it all , plan on sharing. great ingredient for my southwest spice mix recipes , and any dish you might want to spice up.
0	i don &apos;t like this product at all. much tastier and cheaper to just use hot water and a packet of hot chocolate mix from nestle or swiss miss.
1	i like these so well that i signed up for the subscription rate where they mail you automatically every month or so - your choice. we eat a lot of these , but i &apos;ve not roasted them yet. most nuts taste better roasted , so why not ? looking forward to it.
1	my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and our family really enjoyed it. i looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased with the natural ingredients and no calories.
1	super yummy ! really hits the spot when i want a chocolatey snack that won &apos;t break the calorie bank.
0	puzzled as to why this product doesn &apos;t live up to the claims ? you &apos;re not the only one. there does not appear to be any evidence at all to support the claims made. one has to wonder if the testimonials are indeed genuine , given the lack of evidence.
1	i have been buying this coffee for at least 3 years and i love it. smooth taste with a hint of hazelnut. friends enjoy coming over just for a good cup of coffee.
0	the ener-g foods english muffins look good in the packaging , but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom. this presents a gooy feel in the mouth , and both my husband and i got stomach aches. won &apos;t be buying this again.
0	this jam has little fruit taste. if you love damson jam this is not the one for you. it could have been any flavor. all you taste is sweetness.
0	seriously this product was as tasteless as they come. there are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack. you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor.
1	it tough to find good gluten free baking mixes but this one is smooth unlike some that are gritty , and makes just as easily as regular bisquick. it tastes just as good too.
1	first time i &apos;ve ever used agave nectar -- and it is great. keeps the blood sugar stable. great buy also !
0	do not waste your money on this. i waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee , dropped in two tablets. nothing. i dropped in two more. changed the flavor of the black coffee , but not for the better. i had wanted this so i didn &apos;t have to use cream for flavor with all the calories. not even a hint of chocolate flavor.
0	this was not what i expected , tiny plant , followed instructions exactly. fly trap never matured to potential. after 10 days appeared to collapse and by 21 days was dried out.
0	i used to buy these all the time and had no idea the switched to being made in china ! not trusting this company anymore , they just lost another customer. buyer beware !
0	this is made out of hard plastic. i bought this for my shepherd that loves to chew. she &apos;s not interested in playing with it at all. it &apos;s made to be a educational for dogs , i guess she just got bored with it. on the plus side your human kiddos will like it.
0	tossed this out after trying it. texture and taste were far below expectations. seemed kind of mushy and pasty. pricy to boot.
1	the bit o &apos; honey candy that i ordered took me back to my childhood when i used to buy the product. it arrived in a timely manner , in good shape , and of course it tasted delicous.
0	i read through all the reviews before buying this product hoping that i wouldn &apos;t be one of the people who noticed the odor and weird aftertaste. unfortunately it was just too pronounced. i made a couple things with the mix and my family and i all found it awful.
1	the flax seed is packaged in separate smaller packages so that it can stay fresher longer and it was recommended by the flax cookbook i purchased. this seed was cheaper than other brands i had checked on. i am putting it away for any emergency that may arise.
1	shipping was prompt and the product was what i fully expected. it helped me be successful with mama agata &apos;s lemon cake where u.s. flours failed.
1	the best dog food ever for my dog. he has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him. my vet also feels it &apos;s a great product. even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it.
1	good , and reasonable for drink. a product that is good for sleeping and inflamation. i will buy again if the price stays reasonable.
0	i returned this item because it contains palm oil. bad for the body and very bad for our planet.
0	although this coffee tastes fine there is nowhere enough coffee in the pod. the cup that is brewed even with a smaller amount of water is weak and watery.
1	the holiday liquor cups were exactly what i was looking for. the chocolate is delicious and holds up well to the liquors
0	bought these for my little shih-tzu a few months ago and he just will not eat or even chew on these things. and he &apos;s a chewer ! chews on everything else in the house , anyway. i tried coating it in peanut butter and he ate the first one , but the next time i tried he knew i was trying to trick him and wouldn &apos;t go near it.
0	we ordered the earth &apos;s best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack. we got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack , not the dinner pack. found out we can &apos;t return the item , either. we will try the amazon phone help , but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff ...
1	love the ease of having green natural tea anywhear any time . tastes great i love this stash green tea
0	i used to love quaker oatmeal , they they went and changed the recipe , now is tastes like paste with uncooked oatmeal chunks in it. i tried adding more sugar to it , but it doesn &apos;t help. don &apos;t belive they hype when they say it &quot; tastes great &quot; . i would pay to have a box of the classic stuff back.
1	my dog loves , loves this dog food.i had to say love twice , because this dog food is one of his dog &apos;s favorite.
0	this item , werther &apos;s sugar free hard candy , if consumed , will give you - or your friends , loose bowels. i purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem : you can &apos;t return them. need a laxative ? i have ten unopened bags you can have - for free.
0	if you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee , buy this. otherwise stick with starbucks via. i use the instant coffee mid-way through my day at work. the taster &apos;s choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. the starbucks via only needs 1. spend the extra couple of dollars on the starbucks if you want good instant coffee.
1	it is so hard to find a nice juice drink that is either too sugary or , even worse , has additives like artificial sweeteners. the switch orange tangerine delivers on flavor. if you like juice and want a full-flavored orangy-carbonated fizzy drink , this one fits the bill. very good !
1	this is great as a pancake mix. it almost has a corn texture to it. i rate everything by if my son will eat it. he is super picky and loves the pancakes. i tried making biscuits with the mix that didn &apos;t turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks.
1	i really do love these crackers. they are crisp , tasty and low in calories. i have been eating them with a small bit of mayo and potted meat in the morning with my cappuccino. they have helped me lose weight. regardless of that fact , i just like the taste.
0	very weak blend , slightly bitter aftertaste. noticeably light brew when brewing. won &apos;t purchase again , in fact , i regret this purchase. even on 4 oz brew , still really weak taste.
1	not truly spicy my 2 year old loves this stuff ! great on chicken , even chicken nuggets , for spring rolls- the crispy ones and even fries. it &apos;s sweet and spicy all in one so very good
1	the hot chocolate is my husband &apos;s favorite. service was also great , as it usually is. very popular now with winter coming on.
1	this tea is absolutely incredible ! addicted after first taste. so delicious ... the smell ... the taste ... it &apos;s a beautiful experience. i just ordered more ( and gonna try both regular and decaf ) .
0	i bought these for pancakes , and i haven &apos;t used it to make any other recipes , so i cannot speak for how it makes biscuits , or any other item. but for pancakes , it &apos;s a no-go. they have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter &amp; syrup ; but i don &apos;t like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup , so these pancakes are not for me. moving on to other mixes ...
0	i didn &apos;t buy this product but got it as a gift , i tried it and it is greasy , mushy and brown. it doesn &apos;t taste like summer sausage but like a mistery meat mush.it tasted almost like potted meat but worse.i am glad i didn &apos;t waste my money on the product.i won &apos;t recommend.
0	this was purchased as a &quot; warehouse deal &quot; and there was a noticable lack of aroma when opening the package. i do not know if it had just been sitting aroung too long ( brew by 3 / 5 / 11 on package ) or if the lack of flavor / character is normal for this product. two stars because it is still drinkable but boring.
0	i wanted so badly to like these meals since i rarely go out for lunch , but they were awful ! it looks and tastes like gravy , noodles , and potted meat mixed in a bowl. i ordered three different varieties and this was the worst of them all.
0	i received the item and found 10 of them were crushed and spilled onto others. my mother spent about 30 minutes to clean. didn &apos;t want to return as it is not worth my while. always liked this particular creamer but wasn &apos;t happy to see a lot of them crushed inside the box.
1	we became acquainted with this mustard when we were in switzerland and really enjoyed it. that was our reason for purchasing it. great find ! ! we have liked this as much as the one that we bought in europe !
0	these things are low cal oreo &apos;s : minus the creme , minus the cookie ! the title &quot; oreo &quot; is basically a total misnomer. these are nothing but black crackers with some sugar. if that is what you want , then click purchase.
0	these taste really awful. i &apos;ve tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. my guests weren &apos;t delighted when i asked them to try these. don &apos;t recommend.
1	this mix of splenda and sugar works pretty well for me. a teaspoon of it is enough for a large cup of coffee , and it tastes like a real brown sugar.
1	this was the only seed pack i bought of three different brands that came up and the cats are still enjoying.
0	i got two teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were holiday coffees and apple cider ! spicy eggnog ? gingerbread ? bait and swtich. the only redeeming factor - amazon was great and issued me a refund.
1	i highly recommend switch if you are looking for a soda that doesn &apos;t have refined sugar and is loaded with flavor. sweetened with fruit juice ( as opposed to high fructose corn syrup ) , this will definitely quench your thirst. plus , all you tangerine lovers out there , this is the next best thing to eating the actual fruit !
0	i normally use senseo , but since amazon is not a distributer anymore , i thought i try baronet decaf. even with an exp. date of 12 / 13 , it smelled old and tasted old. i thought it was perhaps one package , but no , all 3 packs were the same. i hate to be wasteful , but i had to throw them out. i do not recommend this item.
1	i purchased this product from b-r-us when it was on sale and my son seems to like it. i was scared of previous post of mold and i always double check the food before i stir and serve. he seems to like it , but i recommend the chicken sweet potato dinner.
1	have tried many crackers , including some other dr. kracker , and think this tastes the best. it &apos;s hard / crunchy with lots of seeds on it , so if that &apos;s an issue , it might not be for everyone. buying it in amazon &apos;s 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store.
1	this stuff tastes great ! i am not a decaf person , but perhaps i am being won over by melitta coffee - try it !
0	i ordered the strawberry before. i loved it. ordered the same item again and got a green box with black licorce inside. i don &apos;t want black licorice and do want my strawberry !
1	variety pack of popchips r sooo good all flavors r delicious and r way healthier than regular greasy potato chips .... popchips r half the fat and only 100 calories so a def must buy
0	can &apos;t believe i chose the single box i thought i was getting a two pack ! geez double the price ! pay attention to what you order !
0	these gave me a headache , too much sugar , and other ingredients that didn &apos;t sit well. i would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier.
1	the most awesome cookies on the planet. we need a treat that is not full of sugar and nanas fits the bill for us.
1	this is the king of pancake mixes. easy , foolproof , and delicious , it makes the best pancakes i &apos;ve ever tasted. we &apos;ve been buying it for several years , and the pancakes consistently come out light and delicious. simply add an egg , buttermilk , and melted butter. cook them on a nice hot skillet for a yummy anytime meal !
0	i was excited to try this because i love vanilla lattes. it is the drink i order most often , and make at home on a regular basis. this tastes so fake , similar to the instant vanilla coffee drinks. it does not taste like a vanilla latte that you can get at a coffeehouse.
1	the garlic granules make cooking with the garlic flavor without adding extra salt. the tones quality is exceptional. arrived quickly
0	since i have two babies on this formula , it was a very convenient way to order it. but out of every twelve pack i ordered , at least two cans were dented enough so i didn &apos;t dare use them. it is too expensive when you were getting ten for the price of twelve.
1	these are great crackers. my little guy likes them a lot and best of all , they don &apos;t contain any soy or dairy !
1	these work fine. all i really wanted to try were the paper filters , the plastic is not environmentally friendly. i have a reusable keurig filter but it is messy to clean after use. the paper filters work great in it &amp; i can use my own coffee , which is not available through keurig. i &apos;ve asked if the paper filters could be bought separately but never got a response.
1	i enjoyed this because of the full taste i get out of it without it being too bold or having a burnt taste. to me it is a bit above the medium blend. i do take creamer with my coffee so the boldness may be tamed down. i will definitely order more of this when i &apos;m am out.
1	i usually cringe a little before i do a natural juice / carbonated beverage. there is frequently something of an aftertaste that is unpleasant. this is refreshing , light , very bubbly and leaves a bright taste after with no cringe effects. i definitely would buy this drink.
0	not very good at all -- pineapple is a major ingredient ( lots of big chunks of pineapple with very little bits of chicken )
0	love the other flavors ... this one is horrible. and i cannot return ... oops. this flavor is almost a chemical one , does not taste anything like cheddar and my kids thought the same !
1	i don &apos;t have horses , so i am not using this in the traditional way. our backyard is being redone and all the fences are down. with a pool there , though covered , i was concerned about the wanderers etc. so this came in handy and it was so easy to set up.
1	this product is amazing. i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them ! ! super easy to clean and use. when ordering these , i was under the impression that there were 2 per package ... fyi-they &apos;re not ! ! only one per ...
1	grandpa po &apos;s originals are crunchy nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic soybeans. the healthy snack offers the benefits of soy without genetically modified organisms , cholesterol , peanuts or preservatives. in addition , the snack is low in saturated fat and it tastes great.
1	shipped in great shape. i gave these to my son , he is the one who uses reg coffee and he really likes these disposable k-cups. i guess i will still have to send him coffee beans every mo.
1	i have 3 cats here at home and they need to dosome grazing so i baught this to see if they like it : ) even though its just out grass lol
1	i have used this in my baking with the regular splenda and it works great ! always trying to cut calories with out loosing flavor. works great in my muffins with just a touch of sugar.
1	our family is a huge fan of izze and this was right in line with that. the flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. my favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka ... obviously that &apos;s only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older !
1	if you liked licorice as a child , this is a dream come true. it is soft , and the taste rolls off the back of your tongue---but you can &apos;t eat just one ( box ) .
0	i bought this for a christmas gift , but i will be returning. there is no box or packaging as pictured , it is just 5 white baggies containing the mixes , which would be fine if i was just buying for myself but not for a gift.
1	i brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family. we all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne very much.
0	i &apos;d heard how great this product was , but after trying it , i &apos;ve found it is nasty ! ! if you love peanut butter and i do , this is no substitute. yuck !
1	i am a big fan of sorghum flour for my baked goods. it gives everything a bit of sponge ( especially cakes ) and adds an extra bit of sweet to the baking. i highly recommend this for baking flour mixes - you may not want to add it to savory recipes though because of the light sweet flavor.
1	much hotter than your normal green curry. one pack makes many servings.
1	i happened upon this item in my local deli and being curios i decided to try. they were fabulous better than the regular chips by far. i gives you satisfaction of crunch and flavor in a potatoe chip. great great find.
0	don &apos;t waste your money. the ingredients list includes &apos; spices &apos; which obviously means cinnamon. i simply do not understand cinnamon being used in chili. even after adding ground beef , diced tomatoes and shredded cheese on top ... the taste was still disgusting !
0	this is much too watery. it tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine. after receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients , i &apos;ve decided not to order again. this product if definitely not worth the money.
0	i did not even receive the correct product , what i received were raw unshelled peanuts , but had no option to return them becuase amazon does not allow this. i attempted to contact but got no reply , do not buy from here !
1	if you &apos;ve tried the conventional kettle crinkle chip verson salt and peper , you can &apos;t compare these to those ! these are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat , but oompletely enjoyable. you finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices. great stuff.
0	the gum is too hard and small. the taste is ok , but i have to use two pieces to have enough gum to chew. i would not purchase again.
1	this stuff makes great pancakes and shortcake that i am actually allowed to eat ! my doctor tells me i &apos;m celiac- this was three years ago now. i just hope i can continue to find this bisquick !
1	love them. hardly notice any aftertaste from sweetener. i don &apos;t agree with some of the others that didn &apos;t like it ... will buy again ...
1	these worked great for us. we are able to reuse the plastic parts a couple of times before discarding them. we love being able to use our favorite coffee.
0	these chips were way overpriced for what you get. i bought them for a special recipe , but in retrospect could have used andes candies and saved a bundle.
1	this is a new treat for our &quot; kids &quot; . they are pretty picky eaters , especially my girl ! they both love &apos; em. glad i found this product. reasonably priced too
1	feel like a protein boost ? got the nibbles ? don &apos;t want to succumb to potato chips ? here &apos;s a great alternative ! just don &apos;t let your toddler try to open the package or your peas will be all over the floor making for an expensive snack for the dog and a grumpy mommy.
1	i sprinkle these on oat groats or just grab a handful and munch. i transferred the contents of the package to a ziplock once i opened it and keep it in the freezer to ensure freshness.
0	even when the machine appears to work , you end up with tiny cups of coffee and have to take 2 or maybe 3 attempts at getting coffee out of it. at a minimum though , the water is always hot enough and it makes a fine cup of hot water for tea.
0	hey , the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $ 4.00 per can. no way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can.
1	what else do you need to know ? oatmeal , instant ( make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins ; nuke for 90 seconds ) . more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. it &apos;s still just oatmeal. mmm , convenient !
0	tea should be stored in an airtight container. this paper bag is just folded at the top w / o any seal. tea was tasteless. i should have returned it but i was too lazy to do so. i am sure amazon would have taken it back and would have paid for shipping. i like amazon but not all the products are excellent.
1	when i used the k-cup filter that came w / keurig , i didn &apos;t like the taste of any coffee i used so i stopped using it altogether. however , when i saw disposakups on amazon , i had my doubts but took a chance ... they worked great. plan to keep them in stock.
1	a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don &apos;t taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.
1	since republic of tea discontinued their bing cherry vanilla tea , i was looking for a replacement. the flavor of this tea is very different from republics - it &apos;s better. the smell is very rich , like toasted vanilla and cherry. it almost has a coffee smell , but not quite. i don &apos;t like coffee , but this tea is incredible. glad i found it. best of all , the price !
0	i adore sardines. i &apos;m used to the bela brand , but decided to try these for variety &apos;s sake. i opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food. i tasted them anyway , but was totally grossed out. in the trash it went. stick with bela , super clean flavor , fresh and better sourced. totally different food product. try them with siracha.
1	this was a return buy. i bought 50 to try and loved them. this time i ordered 150.00. they are fab for your favorite coffee
1	outstanding ! delicious ! what on earth are these things ? simple. they &apos;re a yummy mix of nuggets made from organic popcorn and organic dry roasted soybeans. they &apos;re so delicious your head may actually explode once you taste them. slightly unsalted , but majorly addictive , these crunchy snacks are good for you.
1	key lime pie is getting rave reviews throughout my office ! i bought a pack of it to share with my co-workers , as well as the mint chocolate chip and strawberry shortcake varieties. all have been tasty , but key lime pie has been the star. excellent ! !
1	very good taste and a good price , no sales tax , no shipping charges and delivered to my door
1	i have loved kettle brand sea salt and vinegar chips since the first time i tried them. the fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price , was wonderful. i would definitely make the purchase again. they are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich.
1	when ordering in bulk with the repeat shipping option , this tasty tea is a great value
1	i love pamelas baking mix. the 25 lb bag is quite large and the expiration is march 2 , 2010 , only 4 months after my purchase. i will never be able to use that much baking mix in such a short amount of time. not worth it.
1	nice body and full roasted flavor at a reasonable price for a organic &quot; fair trade &quot; . i &apos;d buy the discounted pack again , but full price cost it too much to overcome my desire for an affordable coffee.
1	enjoyed the product , pleasant flavor , used it to in all my cooking , i will be purchasing it again. cans were dented on arrival ... but did not harm the product.
1	i can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn &apos;t dropped in all these years. still a superb product you won &apos;t be disappointed with.
0	the bonsai i got looked nothing like the one i ordered. i was very unhappy when i paid for something that i didn &apos;t want.
0	the biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems to be much easier with a jar and screens. however , the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time.
0	since i &apos;ve had my keurig k-cup coffee brewer i have never had such horrible coffee ! tastes like cardboard ! i usually get either donut shop k cups or paul neuman &apos;s own. also midnight express , all good. but this morning blend junk isn &apos;t any good at all. never again !
1	these backyard bbq kettle chips were a great deal with the promo code. it was nice to have a larger size bag. some kettle chips in the grocery store are only about 5 ounces and we polish them off in one family lunch ! they arrived fresh and were not in crumbles as some other chips from amazon grocery have been. great flavor and all natural !
0	i should have listened to the other reviewers who said this was not the candy they remembered - but i didn &apos;t. instead , i ended up with a bad tasting and stale ( almost impossible to chew ) $ 30 box of candy. do not order this product !
1	these were awesome ! ! they have a great crunchy texture and flavor and are very filling. i bought the variety pack to try all the flavors. didn &apos;t care for the salt and pepper , but loved the rest. will definitely buy more !
1	i love popchips. they have a great crunch without the greasy feel and taste. they are very similar to munchos--very light and fluffy. if you are looking for something to satisfy your salty craving , these are a great way without having to feel so guilty about consuming an enormous amount of calories.
1	my aunt gave me a bag of these and i was immediately addicted. there are actual pieces of beans in the chips and they are not overly salty like other chips. i love the zip , agreed they are awesome without salsa , and no trans fat !
1	i love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. i also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. i have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs , which makes mommy happy.
1	this decaf pod has wonderful flavor. it is much better than their previous decaf &quot; skip the buzz &quot; . i &apos;m glad they upgraded their product.
0	i started reading the reviews to find out if there is caffeine in the vega chai vanilla. low and behold 65 mg per serving. if you are sensitive to caffeine , beware. i have yet to sleep and it is 3 am !
1	excellent. very nice , rich and creamy with the pistachio nut in the middle. mmmm ..... delish ! ! !
1	i added 3 tbsp of sugar and half tsp of pure vanilla and a pinch of alum free baking powder and coconut oil for oil and it came out soo good. my son loved it . i liked it too. the fact that it &apos;s all the major allergens free makes it better.
1	i have a two-year old jack russell terrier and she loves newman &apos;s own dog food ! she ate beneful for a year before switching. this goes down much easier. she doesn &apos;t each eat it &quot; just because she &apos;s hungry &quot; ; she actually likes it ! i highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less !
1	looks fresh and clean ; i have roasted it in the toaster oven and i also use it in food whole or ground up in the coffee grinder.
1	this salsa is definitely one for the books ! ! a perfect blend of the jolokia pepper and seasonings that made this the perfect dip for half-time .. grown men crying because it &apos;s soooo hot is a small price to pay for this awesomeness in a jar ... perfect for my cream cheese dip too ! a + across the board.
0	i found this product disappointing. it did not dissolve quickly and left a gritty residue. it is very high in sugar - almost 70 grams per tab and has saturated fat listed as one of the ingredients.
0	i thought the grove hot chocolate is to sweet. it also has an off taste. i would not recommend this to anybody
0	these emerils gourmet coffee , emeril &apos;s big easy bold , k-cups for keurig brewers ( pack of 50 ) are defective ! ! ! almost half of them blew the tops off in brewing and filled the coffee mug with coffee grounds , and had to throw away. will not by again ! ! !
1	this makes the best tortillas. that is about all i use this for , so it lasts me awhile. mine cost about 1 / 2 the price as listed here , but it was on sale where i bought it too.
1	if you are looking to cut out some cal and want a great taste then go with this. i keep getting it sent to me every 6 months. love it ! !
1	i feel better about feeding this product to my dogs. i was using another popular brand , but it contained a lot of fillers. one of my dogs is &quot; pickier , &quot; so he would prefer a meatier taste , but he does clean it up eventually.
0	i got this is a low cost alternative to my normal jet fuel and it just didn &apos;t measure up. i like strong coffee but this had a bitter taste that i just didn &apos;t care for. also , 3 of the cups had some sort of malfunction and dumped their grinds into my cup-not sure why.
0	the claim that this is the best vanilla flavored coffee i have ever had is just not so. this product does not even taste like good coffee. it does not smell like vanilla and does not even taste like coffee. it is overpriced and terrible as far as i am concerned.
0	arrived in good condition , looks like well-made cans. tastes nice , and i would love to use this product , but unfortunately , i got an allergic reaction from it.
1	after trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options , i find that the grove square product tastes the best. for my personal taste , i find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste. just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat. however , this is not hot chocolate , which may be a turn off for some tasters.
1	i am so convinced these are human animal crackers. they look and taste exactly like human ones ( yes , i tasted it ) and they contain sugar , which is not one of the last ingredients in the nutrition facts either. so ill just give my dog very small amounts.
1	oh my gosh , is this good ! like most people , i &apos;ve been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it. then hubby brought a jar of this home. the tomato flavor is amazing. i will never buy store ketchup every again.
1	so crunchie good ! healthy ~ and the kids love em ! what more do you want in a snack. ( besides a 12-step program to stop eating them. ) they &apos;re fantastic ! ! !
0	this product was not very good at all. it did not have the taste or consistency of the wanted beverage.
0	very disappointed in these nuts. horrible taste. i got my money back and these went into the garbage. will not trust azar again. same thing with the raw cashew pieces. i thought they tasted toxic.
0	i have several different ways of connecting xlr microphones to my computers for use in webinars , and i thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect , but when i tried to use it with a shure sm58 mic the volume it produced was about 25 % of what i am used to , and was not adequate for my purpose.
0	i bought this bag and found it 50 % cheaper at smart and final. it was also old and and white. this was terrible ! i bought it to put in the candy canisters i give to co-workers. so i didn &apos;t find out it was old till a co-worker informed me. i was so embarrassed. do not buy this candy. it all ended up in the trash. very disappointed !
1	i ordered this case of chips as a deal with some vita coco and it was a stellar deal. this size bag is perfect for snacking. the assortment of chips is great , there &apos;s something in there for everyone.
0	i received the package early , which was great. the candy packaging looked fine but i didn &apos;t discover the problem until i opened the bag. half the bag of peanut m &amp; m &apos;s was cracked ! i was really embarrassed to share them with anybody because the entire bagful was dusted with m &amp; m debris. not happy with this purchase at all.
0	certainly not worth the price. it &apos;s only advantage to using jars is it stacks. good luck getting a response from the company if you need any information ( which is seriously lacking with your purchase ) . save your money , use jars.
1	was surprised of the inexpensive price tag and skeptical when purchased. as it turns out , it is a charming and unique gift and a great buy for the price !
1	i chose to purchase in quantity as it is cheaper than the grocery store. i liked the product so i knew what i was getting.
1	we like to mix this with regular coffee because it &apos;s so strong and rich by itself that it makes it go further and isn &apos;t too overpowering.
1	we love sinus buster tea. my husband thinks it &apos;s great and clears out his sinus &apos; regularly.
1	tastes like drinking a cherry pie. i purchased this for my mother &apos;s gout and she told me it works quickly. it &apos;s also supposed to help lower blood pressure. speedy delivery. it &apos;s not 5 stars because of the high price.
1	i bought these lollipops for my daughter &apos;s 3rd birthday. they are super cute and the kids loved them. definitely met my expectations.
0	it was a great value and i like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. won &apos;t order this brand again. great chips otherwise.
0	my dog chewed the rope in half first , then chewed off the spiky ball. finally then he got to some treats. he doesn &apos;t have patience for many toys and this one did not keep his interest. i was not impressed with it. one of the worst toys i have bought.
0	i bought this for my lab thinking it would be a fun challenging toy for him , but he has never even touched it. i put treats in it and he wouldn &apos;t go near this toy ! i tried to give it to my mom &apos;s labs and they didn &apos;t want anything to do with it either.
1	i absolutely love this mix. we keep it on our home bar and everyone loves it.
1	wow , i have to admit these are really yummy. i don &apos;t know how they did it , but they don &apos;t have that &quot; imitation-sugar &quot; taste at all. they &apos;re small little bars ( slightly bigger than the normal hershey &apos;s miniatures ) , but for only 30 calories a piece , they are a perfect afternoon treat when you need something sweet at the office.
1	this product made wonderful pancakes -- i couldn &apos;t taste the difference between this gluten-free version and the original. i tried using it to make pizza dough to relative success. the texture was a little bit weird but it tasted good !
0	i &apos;ve tried other flavors of switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. however , this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. i felt like i was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. while i would probably purchase the other flavors of switch , i definitely would not purchase this one.
1	i &apos;ve decaffinated a few times and always find myself returning to caffinated coffee for the flavor. with this product i won &apos;t have to do that anymore. the flavor of this coffee is exceptional. it &apos;s as full and rich as any off the shelf coffee i &apos;ve ever tasted. highly recommended.
1	my little girl can &apos;t get enough of this ! i like that it is organic and contains fruit , veggies , protein and grains in one tasty meal. i wish it came in larger portions since my 10 month old always wants 2 jars.
1	this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten ! i only buy it on special occassions because i know i &apos;ll eat the whole bag.
1	i rotate between newmans , nature balance , and ceasar milans organic dog food. my dog eat &apos;s all three so can &apos;t say which is better. my main reason to purchase this brand ( or any newman product ) is for the charity the profits goes to. my way of supporting companies that give back.
1	of all the coffee &apos;s available for tassimo this kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by far my favorite.
0	fed to dog and she got violently sick and vomited the whole this up after eating it. don &apos;t buy this product if you love your pet ! ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000ano3n2 &quot; &gt; nylabone healthy edibles bone , roast beef flavored with vitamins , regular size , triple pack &lt; / a &gt;
0	i went to check out and found out that the freight is $ 14.00 on an $ 11.00 ( canned , not fresh produce ) ? ? ! ! ridiculous ! !
1	this sauce has just the right combination of sweet , spicy and mild heat that is perfect for using with a family. the spicy isn &apos;t overpowered with allspice , the way some other brands are. baste this on grilled pineapple for jerk turkey burgers and you &apos;ll be in love too ! my only trouble is finding it in our small town stores ... have had to go to the internet , but it &apos;s worth it.
1	awesome coffee ! ! ! i have ordered this pack of bags twice now and getting ready to order a third. if you like dunkin donuts hazelnut , but don &apos;t like the price this is a great and inexpensive alternative.
0	my wife , just today , bought a 12 oz pkg of this at our grocery story for $ 8.50. the cost here seems like price-gauging.
1	i love this hot chocolate. in my opinion , it &apos;s the best on the market. it has a nice grown-up flavor of chocolate and coffee.
1	i like the mild sweet flavor of this instant tea. i &apos;ve added it to lots of different drinks like juices and energy drinks. i have fun mixing it with things. it blends well for me.
1	my husband and i love this product because it is naturally sweet without the taste of artificial sweeteners. most peach flavored teas taste like sugar and artificial flavors but not this drink. it is wonderfully watery to quench any thirst. i only wish that amazon would always sell it because we would buy it on a regular basis.
0	i emailed customer service and asked if the treats were filled with sweet potato , and they assured me that they &apos;d checked with the manufacturer and confirmed that they did in fact have a sweet potato center. however , the ones i received did not and i feel like i was lied to by customer service because they didn &apos;t want to take the time to actually check into it.
1	the quality of these spices is excellent and rather than buying smaller amounts at huge comparative cost and inferior in quality at a supermarket , this is really the way to go ! i store unopened packages in the freezer for freshness. along with cardamom , this is a spice i use daily so i appreciate the deal here.
1	was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a k cup but grove square is amazing. it is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss. the milk chocolate is mild , the dark has enough bite to make it interesting and the peppermint is perfect for after dinner.
1	this was a new product to me. they were very tasty , crisp , and surprisingly delicious. i was very pleased with this product.
0	after a few uses , this powder spoilt a cake. it has lost its raising power. it is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. avoid this one. i plan to ask for a refund.
0	this is the first time i am giving some negative review for the products that i bought. i have ordered this item to avoid tax and competitive price with costco. but quality of the taste is different from the product that i bought outside stores like walmart , target , costco ... so think before you buy ..
0	this stuff tastes like the pink soap in a a gas station bathroom smells. yuck. i threw the whole bottle away after two tastes. i only took the second taste to see if it really tasted as bad as it did.
1	our family has been wheat-free for 3 years and gluten-free for 1 1 / 2 so we &apos;ve tried just about every mix out there. i just found that bisquick has a gf mix while in the grocery store and decided to give it a try. this is definitely the best mix that we have ever tasted : smooth , not grainy. i don &apos;t know that side-by-side with regular wheat pancakes that you would notice the difference !
0	my cat will go for a day , probably longer , haven &apos;t tryed it , but he &apos;ll walk right by this stuff every time , even when i know he &apos;s hungery. absolutely no interest. i swear he &apos;d rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it ! !
1	i got this at a local discount store for $ 6. it has an excellent flavor and the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead if 5 was personal preference.
1	salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip. these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly. i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste.
1	i have been suffering from post nasal drip and congestion for so many years , and this tea made such a big difference after a couple of days. i drink it 1-2 times per day and i feel so much better. i can breathe easier , and have little or no post nasal drip throughout the day.
1	popchips are very good. the varity received lets you try the diferent flavors. i only wish i could find them locally.
0	the vet beleives that giving my dog this food every day made him sick. ( 1 year old , 12 pound yorkie ) but he loves it. i have to give away the stockpile i had.
1	this cereal is difficult to find in the stores so i appreciate being able to purchase it through amazon. my husband really likes it and looks forward to the delivering of it every month. seems like an unlikely thing to look forward to , but it &apos;s the little things that count. p. looney
0	this new recipe is horrible ! it is watery , almost like a stage 1 meal , and it went from 4g of protein to 1g. most of the veggie pouches have more protein ! definitely not worth the purchase.
0	for the price you pay , the pods should make a good cup of coffee. this coffee was watery and bland. don &apos;t buy. i think tulley &apos;s is the best.
1	fast delivery and good product. this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it &apos;s really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc. such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with.
1	once i tried these i was hooked. good healthy food that tastes good alone or with tuna or seafood salad. light crispy and melts in your mouth.
0	i took a chance seeing the variation experienced by others. the shipment that we received has such a minimal taste of cinnamon that i wouldn &apos;t say they &apos;re cinnamon if given a sample. we opened each of the packs to see if any were a strong cinnamon taste but no luck. i definitely won &apos;t reorder these.
1	i try every asian salad dressing i can find. this is my favorite one for salads because of it &apos;s delicate taste. my other favorite is &quot; newman &apos;s own , low fat sesame ginger &quot; . the ginger in newman &apos;s gives it a stronger flavor which is great as a marinade or just sprinkle on rice and vege dishes.
1	i love this brand .... and please tell everyone you know ... hemp oil is sooooo beneficial for you ... do your research ... you will understand that getting 3 omegas and some
1	we just started using these and my 7-month old daughter really likes them. i &apos;ve tried a couple of bites and they are tasty with good flavor combinations. i love that they are organic. my only complaint not specifically related to the product is that when i got mine in the mail , one of the jars was broken and i had to clean the food off of the other bottles.
1	bought four , 2 lb bags and use them to make bread and pizza dough. if you have fantacies of that perfect italian pizza you had while touring through italia , this flour is just the thing. the dough even smells slightly better , the final product produces the closest thing to that wonderful crust you can &apos;t find in the usa. it &apos;s worth the dough , for the dough.
0	it sure would be nice if they stated anywhere in the description of this coffee that it is flavored. i love the bed and breakfast coffee , it &apos;s just plain coffee , so i was surprised when i received the jamaica coffee and it was flavored. yuck !
0	bought a small smartbones chicken dog chew for our mini dachshund this afternoon from the pet store and just discovered that this product is made in china ! ! no thanks !
1	we really enjoy this coffee. we recommend to store it in an airtight container after opening to maintain it &apos;s full flavor. we enjoy it as an evening coffee.
1	popchips don &apos;t taste like a lot of the other lowfat salty snack options. they are light in taste and big on crunch. great alternative to potato chips. i &apos;m not a fan of the bbq flavor but i do like the sea salt &amp; vinegar , salt &amp; pepper alot and sour cream and onion. like the individual bags - perfect for on the go and lunches.
1	but you will enjoy ever step. i gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. damn it ! they should warn you about this ! tastes awesome though. when i finish my crash diet i will order another box ( case ? ) . : - )
0	i love hot chocolate and was very excited to find a variety pack , however , these are gross. horrible after taste , my kids dont even like them. now i have 3 boxes of the stuff that no one will drink. very disapointed.
1	this is the best olive oil not for cooking as any olive oil will work the flavor and aroma is fantastic brings you to italy use on salads breads for dipping.
0	i purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago , and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won &apos;t open them. i complained to amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case ! i won &apos;t order again.
1	popchips are so good. i have been following weight watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal. these popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence. they taste so good ,
0	all my fault. i thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal. instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. who sells cereal for this price plus $ 8.00 shipping ? i feel stupid ! buyer beware !
1	it is hard to tell most of the time if supplements work but i just have a greater sense of well being when i take this product. it really is a good source for essential fatty acids. i expect to keep taking it.
1	we love love love these muffins. they are moist and delicious ! ! we like them best the day you bake them. the 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up , then they are good as new. our only complaint is that they are difficult to find ! ! but def worth every penny ! !
0	ordered this product to have some canned pumpkin--continuing pumpkin shortage at stores. use a lot of pumpkin ! of 12 cans , 9 majorly dented , 2 minorly dented , 1 ok. amazon refunded entire purchase price--they don &apos;t accept grocery returns.
0	disappointing. i went to a lot of trouble to buy these , as i thought it would be impressive and novel for guests when drinking champagne at christmas. no-one had any useful comments to make , some left half of the champagne and the flowers , although encouraged to eat them.it was a waste of money and champagne should not be interfered with , maybe better in lemonade !
1	this is an addicting , fantastic snack mix. it has a wonderful variety of crackers and blend of flavors.
1	reaaaly hot stuff. way hotter than dave &apos;s ultimate insanity. rivaled only by some of blair &apos;s sauces. i don &apos;t think it is 4 million scoville though .. maybe 1 million.
1	this tea is to die for. it hits the spot. easy to make ice tea. all of my friends love it as well. i am delighted to serve it. i look forward to drinking it , it is my new favorite drink !
0	if you think this is going to be a healthy product , you are sadly mistaken. it still contains 36g of sugar per can ! if you want to end up a fat diabetic , by all means , try it. otherwise , try the zero calorie , zero sugar , zero chemical naturally fruit flavored seltzers like those by la croix.
1	love this hot chocolate--nice creamy flavor. the price is good and i love the single packs. this is not a flavor available to me locally.
1	this is certainly the best caramels i have ever had. i just wish it came in bigger pieces. i finished the whole box in one sitting ! i will certainly buy them again.
1	so so good ! delicious , easy to prepare food ! i would definitely order again. had a gourmet taste , and took only minutes to get ready. yum ! ! !
1	my 3 year old son was just diagnosed with allergies to wheat , egg and milk. i was so upset when i found out but a little relieved as i started finding foods he can eat. yes , they are crumbly but they taste good , my kids like them and they meet his new dietary restrictions. since the option is not giving a 3 year old cookies i don &apos;t mind some crumbs !
1	i roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper ( but i do it outside , of course ) . these beans ( coffee bean direct green mexican altura ) seem to be well-suited for this method. the first and second cracks are distinct , and i &apos;ve roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. the aroma is strong and persistent. the taste is smooth , velvety , yet lively.
0	this is not the product i received. they changed the product. it now has chunks of tomato in the soup. this is not what i wanted.
1	vimto , love it. fekkin expensive here though ! that &apos;s the problem with no longer living back in blighty , stuff like vimto becomes much more difficult to get.
1	good oatmeal. i like the apple cinnamon the best. though i wouldn &apos;t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste. that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.
1	this product works. if you are only looking to do vocals this is a good product. so far i &apos;ve had it a few months with no experience of sound distortion or loss of power. its great if you don &apos;t want to go to the trouble of figuring out how to use a mixer. i &apos;ve been told a pre-amp is better but it seems to work alright for me and my mxl 67g.
0	i had this for 2 days before my dog rolled it off the couch onto a carpeted floor , which caused a 3-inch section of the brittle screw-on bottom to break off , rendering the toy useless--and potentially dangerous.
1	this is more than just a tea , drinking a cup is like a beautiful experience. it has a multi-dimensional flavor , it really does. i never considered myself a tea drinker , but i ordered it once at a starbucks and was hooked ever since. on special occasions or even when i am down , i treat myself to a cup of this warm and delicous tea.
0	i have really been scared to use all these cans i bought due to the dented damage to almost all of them.
1	hands down , by far the absolute worst tasting tea i have ever had .... and i have allot ! i am an avid tea drinker and i just can &apos;t get it down. the benefits are supposed to be amazing so i &apos;ll keep it around to water down and sugar up but wow it &apos;s bad. so strong too , tastes like dirt ( * that &apos;s been pissed on in the woods ) .
1	best bit-o-honey i have ever eaten. i have always bought this product at a local grocery store and it was always hard , i figured it was suppose to be that way. but after eating the box i bought here i now know better ; the candy was soft and delicious. i plan to continue buying bit-o-honey from here.
0	love the flavor , but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen / melted , as if they &apos;d been exposed to heat during filling. my husband used two of the ones that were not affected , so i &apos;m not returning them , but certainly wish quality control had caught this. the affected k cups are so misshapen they will not fit into the space in the keurig.
1	this coffee tastes pretty good , and i like the fact that it &apos;s organic ( coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides ) . however , each time i use subscribe &amp; save , unfortunately , the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later , which is why i had to cancel my subscription to this.
1	i just love this chili--it is beefier / chunkier than other no-beans chilis and the blend of seasoning is simply outstanding--much more savory and less of an assault to the tastebuds than hormel &apos;s in my opinion. goes great on a hot dog , a baked potato , good to dip tortilla chips in and a wonderful companion to grilled cheese sandwiches or just toasted english muffins.
0	white bread is not my thing , so that &apos;s probably why i don &apos;t like this one. i like herby white breads and really full-bodied white breads , but otherwise i always choose whole grains. this one is not full-bodied and has no particular flavor. not interesting at all to me.
1	my son loves these pancakes. much healthier alternative to the original. i am excited to try the other recipes soon.
0	i received medium roast. didn &apos;t receive the correct coffee shown on picture. disappointed by this. i suppose ill try as its a lot of my trouble to return
1	this candy has gotten harder and harder to find. it was down to a couple convienence stores in my area that sold it and they stopped. now a year later i typed in toffifay into bing and up pops amazon. great price for a great candy and i &apos;m well stocked up for the next 6 months. the hard part is not eating it all the first week !
0	the containers explode at the end of the brewing cycle. the grinds fill the cradle that the k-cup sits in and it is messy to clean up. newmans and tilly &apos;s work fine , but emeril &apos;s does not. i have a mr. coffee powered by keuring coffee maker.
1	love this , dont use too much because it is strong , but it tastes great. makes even mediocre salmon taste great.
1	my scottish terrier inhaled hers in about 2 hours , but my finicky pomeranian , who usually turns his nose up at chew toys , loved it ! it kept my pom busy for a few weeks , but he really enjoyed it ! affordable price , fast shopping , great product !
0	these are good but verrry sweet .... they taste kind of chinese sweet bbq sauce ... high protein
1	i got these 2 weeks ago , for the price i wasnt expecting much , but they are really fresh and fragrant i &apos;ve used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great.
1	best coffee i have ever tasted. my wife , neighbors and friends are all crazy over jamaican me crazy ! ! ! you must try it ! ! !
1	a really great sauce but is slightly more expensive than in other stores. it is great for egg rolls or a dipping sauce for many chinese foods ! it is also a great sauce to make chili thai sushi roll.
0	am a recent burr grinder user and have tried a few different beans and this one lacks flavor or body , something &apos;s missing. had the kirkland columbia coffee and that was better but still looking for a really good coffee to brew and this isn &apos;t the one. as one other recent reviewer noted , this just seems weak , not much taste.
1	i gave this a try when it was on special and i totally love this product iam as fussy coffee drinker this product is just a lovely as those higher priced coffee &apos;s that tend to break my bank account .. give it a try
0	the bonsai tree that i received is tiny and unattractive. it looks like someone stuck a twig in some dirt. unlike the image of the advertised tree , it only has one branch. i am not happy with the bonsai tree at all. it also has a little green branch jutting out from one side that adds to the unattractiveness of the piece. horrible false advertising.
1	works with chicken fish beef or pork. fast easy and makes it taste excellent. plus buying in bulk is more than 50 % off from box stores
0	this coffee is extremely weak. it lacks flavor , like drinking a cup of hot water , yuck ! not what i expected from green mountain and the name &quot; nantucket blend &quot; .
1	these were a wonderful surprise , more delicious than anticipated and guilt-free. i liked the smaller size pouches. easy to carry with me ; nice to give as a gift. the bonus is that they are organic. i will be buying more.
1	i used this treat as training reward and my dog loves it. easy to break into smaller pieces. will buy again
1	this is very good tea in an elegant sachet. a little pricier than some but produces a wonderful flavor whether you &apos;re drinking it hot or cold.
0	i have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. i have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. the taste of the popcorn is great , but at least 25 % of the popcorn does not pop. the kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. i will try other brands because to me that is just too much unpopped kernels.
0	these are some of my favorite bars , but these were old and very tough. i could not find a date on them , but they were obviously old. i will not order these on-line again.
1	finally , a cheaper alternative to buying k-cups , &amp; i can use all of the half-full bags of coffee in my cupboard from my pre-keurig days ! works perfectly for both of my keurig machines !
1	this is an excellent product. id does what it says , it will bring shine and health to your pets coat , and the dogs love it.
1	peanut butter and jelly together. how can you go wrong ? it is great and without the worries of gluten makes it even better.
1	our local grocery stores no longer carry tobasco ketchup , so went out to the internet and found it on amazon. i don &apos;t use ketchup all the time for everything , but when i do , i like it spicy. good stuff. i don &apos;t know why our local grocers do not carry it any more. this seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well.
0	i am not a picky eater and generally like most of the meal replacement and snack bars that i &apos;ve tried , but these had a really unpleasant taste at the end , and the texture was not good either. unfortunately , i now have a box with 9 remaining bars that i would not eat under any circumstances.
0	this was the first time i ordered this brand. all six cans were rancid. i wasn &apos;t as lucky as other people who can return them as i didn &apos;t open them right away. i will never buy products from this company any more.
1	these little buggers are tough to find so i was happy to get a big pack at a good price online. my daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece , not all that unhealthy.
0	i purchased this as a present but it doesn &apos;t come as shown in the picture. it is little white bags with the flavor written on them. someone receiving it as a gift wouldn &apos;t even know what it was unless i explained it to them. will be returning.
1	great with bratwurst , breakfast sausages , salami , cheddar cheese , sandwiches , etc. , even though it is a bit exotic / expensive to use with sandwiches where it tends to fade into the background , it &apos;s best to keep it simple and let it stand out.
1	arrived nicely packaged and sealed. an aromatic , lovely tea that i love to blend with others to make custom iced tea blends. i love this oolong orange with fruity black teas. recommended !
0	the jack link &apos;s 30 jerky strips were verrrryyyy skinny ! some were only about 1 / 8 inch wide and counted as one strip. if i had known this , i would not have ordered the beef jerky strips - tasty , but totally not worth the money ! ! ! !
0	these look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. you would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. they taste like cheap kool-aid and not the yummy jelly belly ones i can &apos;t seem to find on amazon.
1	this is a great snack to have instead of potato chips. lower in calories but still delicious. will be ordering them again.
1	i adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn. i live in a small town and found no dog food that didn &apos;t contain mainly corn. this was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it. it &apos;s an added bonus that it comes straight to my door.
1	if you haven &apos;t had coconut water with pineapple juice before then you need to try this ! simply delicious and so healthy for you !
1	they work great , now i can use my on coffee and that is nice only four littlt steps. cup-filter-coffee-lid
0	can &apos;t understand what the fuss is about. bakes better than 100 % coconut flour , of course , but not worth the taste or health sacrifices.
0	i wanted to like the three flavors of these i ordered ......... but , i just cannot enjoy them. they taste nothing like the fine indian food i enjoy eating out. in fact the after taste reminds me of any food that is old. will not order again. two stars because they tried.
1	we cook a lot of chinese dishes in our household and this sweet chili sauce is a must have ! one of our favorites is sesame chicken , but we couldn &apos;t seem to get the flavor just right ... that is , until we added this ... yum ! !
0	ok for one the bonsai tree was only 3 &quot; tall you don &apos;t get any off the rocks that are in the picture besides 1 rock that is supposes to be the big one but its only the side of a quarter. very disappointed ! ! ! !
0	it was neither fresh nor tasty. perhaps if they wrapped it in an airtight container it could change my opinion but by the time i got it it tasted as if it been lying around gathering dust. the flavors of the tea didnt matter because they were overshadowed by the other factors. had high hopes but had to toss it all out.
1	i have celiac disease , and i try to keep the refined sugar to a minimum , and i was suprised by how good these are ! the light crunch is a shock at first , but is tasty. it is a tad dry , so i am only giving 4 stars. but the taste is great considering how healthy it is ! !
1	you can find this 6-pack for $ 40 dollars less at diapers.com. no reason they should be charging this much.
0	this is awful. so , i got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt , little sugar and no butter fat tomato soup using fresh tomatoes. tastes much , much better than this tomato soup !
1	i bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a very picky eater as of late. i wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and veggie servings each day. this does the trick ! he loves them and he can feed himself. what more can i say ? ( oh , i actually tried one , and they really are good ! )
1	i love the flavor that this hot chocolate has. it is very rich and smooth. have tried other brands but did not get the results i wanted. i will definately be ordering from this company again.
0	i did not know that pace mexican four cheese was discontinued until just now when i googled ... my husband just went to 4 different grocery stores looking for it since that is one of the ingredients of one of my very best personal recipes ! ! i am very disappointed that once again a company discontinued something that was just fine ! ! ! now i have to write pace next. : ( (
1	seriously a great orange drink on par with orangina without being super crazy sweet. i have purchased this frequently since my first taste of it through the vine program. also ! goes great with vodka or tequila !
0	i ordered this product 1 / 17 / 10 and was sent notification that it was backordered. the only reason i ordered it online was because my local health food store was out of it for weeks. meanwhile , the health food store has been restocked for a month , and i have not received the product from my online order yet. i like the product very much , but order it from another supplier.
1	i am a mustard lover , i eat mustard on everything. without a doubt it is the greatest. unfortunately you can only buy in a few stores &quot; beaver honey mayonnaise mustard &quot; maggie
1	in my area one cannot find cinnamon mentos. i am so happy i was able to find this flavor. i just love this product.
1	i have some nice mics round my place for video and thought i could use them to help my skype chats , and for the money it is amazing little usb device.
1	i love this beaver brand honey n mustard mayonnaise sauce. it is the best combination that i have ever used. makes a great dipping sause for cheeses
1	cooking with fresh ingredients always makes your dishes taste , and smell , more delicious ! highly recommend purchasing these vanilla beans , they arrived vacuum packed and ready to use.
0	the sugar police strike again and ruin a oatmeal taste that was always selling out in my local supermarket ... now the huge flakes and horrid taste has made me an ex-quaker consumer. there are plenty of choices out there for low sugar oatmeals why screw around with this classic , or why not just make another version and leave this one alone ? horrible
0	i wouldn &apos;t say my twins are picky eater , but they wouldn &apos;t eat this one. they eat just about every gerber &apos;s organics.
0	shake n bake is one of those products that has a limited market. while i like the crunch factor , it can be hard to keep the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom. it &apos;s really a glorified breading which is about as easy to make as boiling water. if you like it fine , but for me i &apos;d rather make a dish from scratch.
0	oh my god ! i bought this tea as i &apos;ve read many good reviws , but when i recieved it i was very dissapointed ... it was the worst tea what i &apos;ve ever drunk ...
0	we have two cats and four dogs. the cats seemed to like this treat but the dogs turned up their noses at it. one of them , a chiweenee , eats just about everything and he would not touch it. he tried it and left it laying on the floor.
1	my family and i love almond crunch , they &apos;re just sweet enough , very crunchy , and a perfect snack.
1	this is a fantastic bread mix. i do not use the bread machine , i make it in a bowl , hand made , and have had no problems at all. i do not know why people are having any problems with this. it is terrific. amazon , please keep this in stock. please.
1	this is the same food we get at pet store. but it &apos;s delivered to my door ! and for the same price or slightly less.
1	these are my favorite chips ! the bbq and salt &amp; pepper are the best ! the texture of these things rock ! all nicely packaged. gluten free if you care. i don &apos;t but some have commented on that.
1	my son who has celiacs loves the pancakes you can make from these , and so do i ... and i will eat them , even though i don &apos;t need to eat gf ! highly recommend !
0	arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags ! !
0	was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless , the fruits were ok , and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute. seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup. it kicks ass.
0	the expiration date says oct 2013 , but smells like rancid oil upon opening. this is the second container i have purchased from two different stores ( the first one also smelled horrible and i threw it out ) . this tells me if it is a bad batch , it must be a huge bad batch. i am going to look for another cereal for my baby.
1	we live in tucson az and all of a sudden we can &apos;t find this one product anywhere in tucson. i makes the chicken so juicy and tender and the flavor is beyond compare. so happy to be able to purchase some and looking forward to buying more ! ! ! !
1	love this substitute for brown sugar. always stays moist and no one can tell that i am using it , instead of regular brown sugar.
1	i was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks. switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and i have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet.
1	after my husband &apos;s enthusiastic reaction to the glutin-free bisquick biscuits , i rediscovered an old bisquick recipe booklet and used its recipe to make an &quot; impossible &quot; cherry pie. he loved it ! next i &apos;ll try the impossible pecan pie. this is the first gluten-free product that my husband really likes. i will buy again although i &apos;d like to find it packaged / sold less expensively than on amazon.
0	have a co-worker who drinks only decaf , we got this and it &apos;s terrible. tastes burned , bitter and even smells awful. i tried b / c i hate to waste but i will be getting rid of this , i can &apos;t bring myself to drink it.
1	you will love this jerky if you are a beer drinker. recommend this product for sure for them nights around the campfires !
1	we can rarely find these potato chips where we live , so i decided to find them online to satisfy our cravings. we cannot be happier with the ordering from amazon ! the chips arrived fast and in a box that protected them from crushing. excellent and will be ordering again !
0	my dog figured this out in 20 secs and quickly lost interest right after. just spinnning a little opens up all the food compartments. also , its hard to get at some of the food given how narrow the opening is. would not recommend.
1	love these crackers and all of the dr kracker products. i use subscribe and save to save a little bit of money and to insure that i don &apos;t run out. i pretty much eat one every day instead of bread. my current favorite topping is goat cheese !
1	i have a husband who could bathe in pace picante salsa , i wish amazon would put it on their subscribe and save program. i ordered two bottles and during shipment one of the lids broke and salsa went everywhere. amazon immediately gave me my money back , i &apos;m surprised my husband didn &apos;t eat the salsa soaked box for dinner.
1	had this sent to me in afghanistan. the flavor was enjoyable but not to spicy. it is made with quailty ingridents. i would surely say this is one of the best salsa &apos;s i &apos;ve ever had.
0	compared to other fussie premium cat foods we tried this seems to have less in the can. we had them in 3 different occasions and cans do not have as much food so our cats feel hungry very soon.
1	this coffee company delivers on great coffee taste ! ! i like my coffee with deep , robust taste and jeremiah &apos;s always is ! ! it makes me glad to purchase it ! ! thanks ! !
0	two of the six packages had lost their vacuum seal so were completely tasteless. the still-sealed ones were not nearly as tasty as yuban. i would not buy this product again.
0	i have spent a lot of time in scotland and i could not swallow these- dusty and dry- i threw them out
1	i &apos;m very picky when it comes to chips. i &apos;ve gone through so many , but this one really hits the spot. it has just the right amount of crunch , with just the right amount of flavor. it &apos;s also great to know that you &apos;re not eating something that &apos;s bad for you. with 100 calories a pack , it &apos;s definitely the ideal snack !
0	i love wolfgang puck products but the coffee is very disappointing. there is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted ! some troll must have changed out all the real puck products ! libbie
1	this product has helped our friend to be able to eat again. she is going to college and finding things to eat has been hard. for her , we send her a supply every month so now she can make her own food and not get sick !
0	i have ordered breakfast blend over the last three years. the last order i received through amazon was just awful ! bitter , burnt , undrinkable ..... what are they doing to my once favorite coffee ? ?
1	nice combination of ingredients so that it is very hot , yet still has great flavor. it has a little added sugar , which adds a nice bit of sweetness to the mix. for the hotter salsas , you really can &apos;t go wrong with this. this is one of my top four favorites , which include mrs. renfros hot salsa , screaming sphincter and pain is good # 37.
0	there are way too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie ... at least for my tastebuds. whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far -- to the point that it is actually nauseating. obviously , i won &apos;t be ordering this one again.
0	of course the keurig green mtn hot cocoa is the ultimate in convenience , but , frankly , the flavor is not so hot. best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard. everything else about it is fine ( consistency , ease of use ) , but g.m. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate.
1	woeber &apos;s hot &amp; spicy mustard is oh so good ! i &apos;ll buy another case when this gone. makes a great gift as well !
0	the candy was sent for a birthday gift. it is the first time using this company. the person receiving the gift said some of the candy tasted old. however , the company is giving me a full refund.
0	sent this as a gift , and found out later that many items were stale. they loved the thought , though , and loved the way it looked.
1	these little cups are a perfect compliment to our k-cup varieties ! we use them for our coffees and loose teas. i was not disappointed and they are much easier to use than the reuseable cups sold by keurig ....
1	these are the only kind of cocoa k-cups i have tried , as i have a fairly new machine. my only complaint is that it seems like the taste of chocolate in the milk chocolate version needs a bit of a boost. however , i usually add another teaspoon of regular cocoa mix and the taste is great. the peppermint and dark chocolate k-cups are delicious. definitely worth a shot for this great price !
1	very high quality food that my dog will actually eat .. always ships promptly and well packaged
1	i &apos;ve been very pleased with the natural balance dog food. our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. since switching i haven &apos;t had any issues. it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger / smaller sized dogs.
1	a good cup of hot chocolate ... with a couple of marshmellows. make it for my daughter every time she visits. she is nearly 60 , and she loves it.
0	i paid $ 15 for kit kat 4pk 70 % cocoa dark chocolate and received one pack , not four. when i queried the company , they ignored me. unless you are comfortable paying $ 15 for a small candy bar , i would avoid these guys.
1	beef sticks and honey - what a great combination ! the ole smokies beef sticks are full of flavor. adding honey gives them a little twist of sweetness that just puts them over the top. the honey stung ole &apos; smokies are always a favorite with our friends ; the saddlebag pack is a perfect take-along to football parties.
0	i blame myself for trying to save a buck - this coffee is way too weak for my tastebuds - they say it &apos;s a dark blend but it &apos;s not even close to a dark roast i buy at stores. in the end , i have blend each can with a pound of dark roast and it &apos;s ok.
1	this product is perfect for my cavalier king charles spaniel puppy. his stools are very regular and healthy. my vet was very pleased to know i picked this product instead of a regular store brand. it &apos;s all natural and my puppy loves it. : )
0	this says 4 pack ... so i assumed like other purchases that i made that it was 4 boxes each with 4 packs. big mistake ! you only get four little pouches. who would pay over $ 2 for a little squirt of applesauce ? don &apos;t make the same mistake. buy elsewhere.
1	the price is great , the serving is just right for a snack , and its a cookie. buy a bunch and they send it to your house ! !
0	dont be fooled - this is not a health cereal. the second ingredient is sugar and this cereal also has fructose in it. i feel like i &apos;m eating kid cereal. it would be healthy if it had less sugar in it. carb-conscious people and diabetics beware.
1	this product is so useful in managing a gluten-free diet ! the inced. price @ amazon .com makes it all a great buy.
1	what a great way to help with dieting and keeping on track. these are very tasty and crunchy - great with sandwiches or salad or even by themselves.
1	these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many , a handful or two does the trick. very crisp and savory.
1	this flatbread is just delicious. i love all the various seeds , very crunchy. there is a hint of sweet but in a delicious way.
0	zero stars for this item. i couldn &apos;t even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle. this lacks any aromatic attraction at all. i &apos;d be afraid to put it in anything i planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item. as for the famous jr service , my complaints about this product have been ignored.
0	these are the worst gluten free cookies i have ever tasted. they were hard , dry and tasted like tapioca flour. avoid these at all cost.
1	love this water. feels silky smooth and clean when you drink it. really love the bottles. nice and sturdy. no squishy plastic. and since i had hard time buying and carrying from the grocery store , love the automatic delivery to my back door ! a little more money than store brands , but well worth it.
1	this is honestly the best seasoning salt in all the land. it tightens up any dish ; not spicy , just perfectly seasoned. it &apos;s perfect , hence , my purchase of this 35 oz. mamma jamma.
1	best mix on the market for making cafe mocha lattes , and we &apos;ve tried them all
1	i bought this for my sister for christmas ... she loved it , but was afraid she &apos;d eat all of it at once , so she took the box to work. within 1 hour , it was finished by all her interns !
1	popchips are a great guilt-free way to add some crunchy satisfaction to your diet without added excess fat and sugar. they are clean , light , deliciously satisfying and are available in a variety of flavors.they would make a great lunch box addition. popchips will be on hand in our home from now on !
1	these are great chips. i have tried both the salsa fresca and sweet chili and love them both ( if i had to choose one over the other would take the salsa fresca - just my personal preference ) . will be trying the sea salt in the near future. can &apos;t go wrong with these chips !
0	this is the nastiest fresh mixer by healthy choice i have had. i still have the taste in my mouth and want to vomit. the water chestnuts add nothing but vegetable content , and the teriyaki sauce is disgusting. i didn &apos;t purchase it from amazon but from a regular grocery store. do not buy ! i recommended the sweet and sour chicken though : )
0	i bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because i see it everywhere. it was nasty. i will never drink this crap again , i don &apos;t care how &quot; good &quot; it is for you. the taste is disgusting and i &apos;d rather just drink regular water. blah !
1	this is a great temporary fence for 1 or 2 horses. it is kinda unwieldy and you may need a little help setting it up if you are a smallish person but it works great after setup.
0	i was very excited to try this coffee flavor , but when i did , i was very dissapointed. i think the flavor is too strong , especially since it tastes really fake. it almost tastes like there is alcohol in it. since i ordered the double box , i gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. i would never buy this coffee again.
1	these arent diced , its just mush , but i like the no bpa and would buy again for that reason- but dont expect diced.
0	i &apos;m drinking my first cup right now. the rest of the package is going in the freezer for emergency use only. it is not full bodied , it is not full flavored .... maybe they think dark roast refers to color ? don &apos;t waste your money on this one ! blech .... weak brown water ...
1	the popchips are a nice alternative to potato chips. they are not greasy and only 100 calories per bag. great for dieters. fits in with a low calorie diet. definitely would recommend trying at least once.
1	love this product. very flavorable to most anything. works great on lunch meat , ham , potato salad , more. something similar is sold at honey baked ham locations , but this product is much better.
0	i tried this once and just tossed a whole box in the garbage. the cereal looks like cinnamon toast crunch but it taste like some sort of fake caramel substitute. it has a powdery coating that is worse than the butt end of a regular box of cereal with all the broken crumbs in the bottom. the carmel flavor tastes fake and almost made me gag a few times.
0	i guess there is a reason that the ingredient section on this page doesn &apos;t mention that the first ingredient is trans fat ( partially hydrogenated oil ) . had i know , i would not have purchased this. consumers need to vote with their dollars and avoid buying items where the manufacturer is using cheap and unhealthy ingredients.
1	it &apos;s a pretty good sub for the coffee shop version. no mess and the s &amp; s price is great ! i like that the box has perforations to remove part of the side so that it functions as a dispenser.
1	these are great for at work , just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. this is the best tasting coffee. it &apos;s easy to make without a mess.
1	i was quite pleased with e flavor of this product. a good , strong , yet not overpowering flavor. rich chocolate flavor. very pleasing. i highly recomend this product !
1	i was looking for a healthier alternative to splenda and equal , nustevia taste great and this container lasts a long time.
0	tastes pretty crappy. it &apos;s like raw cookies. it &apos;s not even like a cookie. it &apos;s a squishy thing in a cookie shape
0	i bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. my dog loved it , but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. good concept but plastic too brittle. company does stand behind it , just not good for my dog.
1	these pumpkin seeds are the quality i have grown to expect from bob &apos;s products. this is the best price i have been able to find on pumpkin seeds and enjoy them on a daily basis , especially in the morning with oatmeal.
0	this company has removed these from store shelves as they may have been making dogs sick. go to pet food tracker on the net for lists of food and treats to be wary of.
1	the walnut oil has a wonderful taste to it. i have used it in salads , salad dressing , couscous , and a variety of other things. thank you for a wonderful product. definately worth the money.
1	baby white popcorn from wabash farms pops nicely , has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth , and is very tasty. what more could you ask from a popcorn ? i highly recommend this product. at least a four star.
0	shame on you amazon for allowing such crooked , highly over priced item to sell on your site. i &apos;m talking about &quot; nestle coffee creamer vanilla caramel sugar free powder 10.2-oz. sold by mancor and fulfilled by ..... wait for it .......... amazon. $ ! 5.00 for 1 10.2-oz jug , bottle , jar. outrageous. does amazon not screen for deceptive sale practices ?
1	i &apos;m not sure why , but this is our favorite pancake &amp; waffle mix. just tastes the best to us.
0	i bought these for my son to take to work for lunch. apparently his co-workers found the smell so offensive they asked him not to eat it at work again. maybe it was a bad batch ...
0	they &apos;re ok i guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. you &apos;ll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. also , no matter what you set the timer on the microwave , you will have little burn / hardened pieces. so you &apos;re not even getting a whole lot out of one bag.
1	what a pleasure it is to be able to use my own coffee , even make cups up to take to work with me ! these are easy , mess free alternatives to the apparatus i bought to use with my machine , there are no coffee grounds in my sink now !
1	i would recomend this product for it &apos;s fine qualities and taste really good. very nice and crisp for any snack or with meals when you want to help on the lowering of carbohydrate intake.
1	i love the walnut oil. it came in cans which i like a lot because you hardly see them any more. the walnut oil was better quality than any of the walnut oil i bought in my neighbourhood and cheaper even with the shipping charge. i recommend it to anyone.
1	this is the best energy product i have ever used. it starts working right away and keeps you going for a long time.
1	i always feel refreshed when i drink this coconut water. the pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. it has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
0	four of the eleven glass vials arrived broken. the product is apparently not able to be returned , so i just wasted 55 dollars.
0	nasty , overly salty , artificial smoke flavor , and simply disappointing. really does not taste like bacon. texturally disappointing as well. instead of the light fluffy experience of mayonnaise , this stuff is runny , gloppy and dense. would give it zero stars if possible
1	i have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years. the roland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used , including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the usa.
1	my son really enjoys all these flavors- eats them all ! ! ! fast shipping. no shopping in stores. great prices. would recommend to all.
1	i feel good about the quality and mix it with canned pn food. she doesn &apos;t care for it by itself but then she doesn &apos;t like any dry dogfood.
1	best taste pasta. cooks very well , slightly less time than typical mass produced pasta. nice color and mouthfeel. just excellent.
1	the panda black licorice is an excellent product. the raspberry flavor tastes mostly like molasses. this is fine if you value an all natural product , but it is not what i expected. the two flavors that i bought have all been consumed so they tasted good.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000ldomt6 &quot; &gt; salt &amp; pepper flavored giants sunflower seeds &lt; / a &gt; i found these seeds in a local store only to fall in love with them and then find the store no longer supplied them. i am so glad they can be purchased at amazon. warning ! ! ! they will ruin your desire for any other kind of sunflower seeds ! great !
1	although the taste leaves something to be desired , 5-hour energy worked very well. i drank one halfway through my workday , and pepped up enough to go out and wash the ambulance. my arms hurt later that night , but the product itself worked for me.
1	great price. wonderful product. everything was as described. shipped quickly and was priced great as far as i can tell. i use these to infuse vodka. ( slice the beans down their length first ) . wonderful !
