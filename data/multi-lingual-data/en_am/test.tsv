1	these popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie , crunchie snack. they are much lower in calories / fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. i especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips.
1	i wanted something easy , tasty , and healthy to sub for my diet soda addiction. this did the trick. i drank it for 10 days without adding any sweetener. once you get past the color , which is a nasty green , the tea is tasty. about a half tsp of sugar really adds to the taste. i will buy this again !
1	of all the coffees i &apos;ve tried -- and i &apos;ve tried a bunch -- this is hands-down my favorite. great bold taste but no bitter aftertaste. i drink coffee all day , and i like it strong and fresh. it can be difficult to find a stronger tasting coffee that &apos;s really great without cream or sugar , i drink my coffee black. i &apos;ve not yet found anything i like better. yum ...
0	my 9 1 / 2 month old would mush this around in her mouth and not swallow it. there isnt much she doesnt like but she sure doesnt like this stuff. it looks like a weird mushy green stuff. i am sure it is super healthy but she didnt like it at all.
1	very excelent quality preserve lingonberry , , i will order it again , , but the shipment pack should be covered better with strong materials , , thank u for the great felix lingonberry
1	the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability. it &apos;s full , but compact. i haven &apos;t run out yet , and probably won &apos;t for a couple months , but i can &apos;t wait to buy it again.
1	i love pico pica. it adds some flavor , and it &apos;s not too hot. i eat it at least 2 meals every day. it &apos;s good on eggs , it &apos;s good on pizza , it &apos;s good on vegetables. really , you can &apos;t go wrong.
0	my puppy just preferred to eat the toy than the treats. my older dogs were curious but did not do any thing. however the red plastic is pretty stong. my dog has been chewing on it for a few days. so if anything it gives your dog something to chew on other than your shoes.
0	although a snap to prepare , this just isn &apos;t for me. most of all it &apos;s too sweet. it also contains too many ingredients. i prefer making my oatmeal the slow way , controlling the amount of sweetness and without all the additives.
1	the kids love the hot cocoa and i like the fact that i can get the stuff shipped to me when i need it without worry of order.
1	all the dogs on my christmas list loved this. they ate it right away
0	the bag should have been labeled &quot; mice ears &quot; . there wasn &apos;t a decent sized ear in the bag. i will buy from the local pet store from now on. the price ended up being the same and the quality is better.
1	these cookies were a big hit at our progressive new year &apos;s eve dinner. everyone enjoyed reading their fortune each time we arrived at another house. they really kept the party moving ...
1	i love , love this green tea. it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually don &apos;t get as many boxes as i did with this merchant. i will definitely order from this seller again ! ! thanks ! ! i depend on my green tea fix everyday !
1	my son loves these &quot; fruit bars &quot; they are smaller than your typical wheat fruit bars. my suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones ... now my son favors them ( chocolate ) ones more than the berry ones ...
1	you will not find a better loose green tea for the price. i was able to get free shipping as well since i bought it with something else that totaled over $ 25. this is the tea used by many japanese people. do not fall for those high-priced &quot; organic &quot; green teas produced by american companies. they are good ... but you are not getting anything better than hime ban cha tea.
1	it is a tiny bit grainy .. but it doesn &apos;t bother me a bit , my kids really like it - i use this as a &quot; chocolate syrup &quot; substitute in my kids milk to make the box go further - they really love it - it &apos;s great drinking it full strength too. not too sweet. we love it !
0	i love these - they taste great. but i get them in the local dollar store. two stars for the value , five for taste.
1	i used this variety pack to introduce protein into my daughter &apos;s diet. she loves all four of the varieties !
1	i love this tea. and it makes you feel very healthy , which is so needed during the christmas and new year season .. i haven &apos;t used it in one week , and i can soooo feel my body needing a good detox. i recommend for anyone who has stomach issues , over indulges , and wants to feel generally better.
0	low calorie , its true. try other flavors not salt &amp; vinegar. wish i could return them , but we ate 2. or at least tried to , yuck !
1	our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food. they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great. they are fit and not over weight. this vendor ships extremely fast. is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book !
1	we have a little shih tzu who absolutely loves cesar softies dog treats. we have tried different flavors , but she seems to enjoy the grilled chicken flavor the most. they are soft enough to break in half , and that is more than enough to satisfy a little dog &apos;s yearning for a reward.
1	i order these olives a lot. they are un-like any other olives out there. the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses. one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests.
1	i too am so glad amazon sells this ! ! i sometimes add a 1 / 4 cup of sugar when i want it sweeter : )
1	well worth the money. i did the calculations on different bags and this dollar amount is an excellent value. there are approx 2338 pops in the box. so far i &apos;ve been through about half the box and have found about 3 without wrappers. that &apos;s pretty good considering. if you need 30lbs of dum-dums go for this product. enjoy.
1	i grew up eating bisquik , so finding a gluten-free version of the quintessential baking mix was wonderful. however , a 16 ounce box only makes two batches of pancakes ! i would love it if the gf bisquik could be made in a box size like the conventional bisquik - especially since my family eats up the pancakes this makes even more than the regular ones.
0	it seems alot of items on amazon get undeserved glowing reviews. i tried these ( original and chocolate ) because of the reviews but they &apos;re nothing special. i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll end up throwing them away when they go stale. this has happened to me before so i wonder if amazon pays people to write reviews ?
1	i like this hot cocoa very much it has a very rich taste compared to the others i have tried.just bought some more of these. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b005k4q1vi &quot; &gt; grove square single serve hot cocoa cups , milk , k-cups for keurig brewers , 24-count &lt; / a &gt; a + + + ! ! ! ! cocoa !
1	as a child my facorite memory was drinking sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my granddad. i have never seen it in a tea bag before. i found that to get the taste i remember i needed 2 bags per cup. the bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that i will buy again and again. plus the shipping time was great.
1	great product to tide me over with my supply of starbucks til they start making k-cups. easy to assembl and use with my own ground coffee.
1	they did a very good job with shipping the order quickly .... nothing like ace hardware who took a week to ship
1	my 9 year old daughter has celiac disease , and these are one of her favorite cookies ( other than the ones i make ! ) they are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she doesn &apos;t feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations.
0	i have a big sweet tooth and thought i would really like this , but it was too sweet even for me. i even tried adding water , but that didn &apos;t help. i haven &apos;t tried any of the other flavors , so i can &apos;t comment on the brand in general , but i &apos;ll never try this flavor again.
0	kettle brand chips used to be so good ... oily , crunchy , flavorful. i suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. now they &apos;re no better than any other big name brand chip. try the good health kettle style olive oil chips instead. they are as good as the kettle brand once was. r.i.p. , kettle brand chips. : (
1	great tea ... i have checked other stores ie : target , kohls and they are more than this tea costs plus the boxes you get on amazon are bigger quanities.
1	i don &apos;t usually like really crispy cookies , but the taste of these changed my mind. i like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories. i often go for &quot; quantity &quot; over &quot; quality &quot; so i would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie.
0	there was no seal of any kind on jar. cap had loosened slightly and some of the paprika had spilled out. would not chance using an open jar so in the trash it went.
0	if you have a dog , you probably know the distinctive &quot; dog fart &quot; odor. this food , for some reason , multiplied that for one of my two dogs. it really turned our house into a constant dog gas zone. wow. it &apos;s supposed to be a pretty good dry dog food , but beware of the possibility of dog gas.
1	i bought these vanilla beans about a month ago to make homemade vanilla extract and also to have on hand since i always seem to have some culinary use for vanilla beans. i was very impressed with the quality. the dried up store bought vanilla beans cannot compare to these. will be ordering more soon !
1	these are my favorite bars ever. the combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful ! very filling ! these are hard to find in the stores. i &apos;m thankful for subsrcibe and save !
1	we switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip &apos;s bowel movements are so much more dense and compact. our vet says its a sign of good food. nuff said.
0	i am still waiting for my order. it has been over a month and still nothing has come. i have other orders i made weeks after that have come.
1	this is exactly what i wanted. it is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store. thank you so much ! ! i &apos;m new to the gluten free diet and this is perfect ! !
0	i ordered these crackers because i &apos;ve recently become allergic to wheat and have to eat gluten free. these crackers arrived crumbled. there were maybe 5 whole crackers in the entire box.
1	tried this because it is 100 % kona and much cheaper than the other national brands i have been using. what can i say i am greatly surprised. mild , no bite too it and no discernable acidity. this is on my shopping list from now on.
1	i figure i would brag , i live in buffalo and just got 3lbs for $ 7.98 ! but seriously the best hot dogs ever
1	this tea won an award in the usa and i know why .... &quot; mandarin silk loose leaf oolong tea &quot; is like the name suggests &quot; silk &quot; silk on your tongue. a tea that has a warm , relaxing taste that makes you feel wonderful ... well done &quot; art of tea &quot; !
0	i just bought the emril k-cups and have used about 12 of them and half if them exploded in my kurig machine. it was such a pain and waste of money because i enddd up throwing them away and using. another k-cup because the coffee was full of grindes. and i cant even write to the seller yo complain !
1	breakfast cookies are a favorite with the young children ( ages 6 and 9 ) of a friend. these one-ounce cookies are the right size for young children. the are individually wrapped , and can be used at home or as a take along snack item. they can also be used as special treats on occasions like halloween.
1	i love this brand , all kernels pop and they are a nice size , texture and flavor.
1	this is the only food my daughter will eat consistly. she really enjoys it. the packaging is great. never had any broken ( having ordered 4 times ) .
1	good stuff - like lentils you don &apos;t need to soak these. they are small so feel good in the mouth.
1	most if not all of the cans were dented in some way , however it is a cheaper method of purchasing this product
0	i got this through a decaf keurig assortment pack ( also from amazon ) and while i have enjoyed all of the flavors - thisone was so weak - i had to post a review.
0	i took 3 sips of these tea , and i nearly gagged. i think it tastes spicy , like nutmeg. i can &apos;t stand the taste or smell of nutmeg , so i can &apos;t drink this tea. just my two cents.
1	this is my husband &apos;s new favorite tea ! i &apos;m not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be buying more.
0	i ordered both the beef and turkey flavors. my dogs would not even take these in their mouths. both flavors were very dry and had no real aroma to them. try a small quantity first. i donated the entire order to the humane society.
0	my son had a constipation problem when he was around 13 months. he tried this at a family member &apos;s house and loved it. it also helped with the constipation. so i ordered a pack and he really did not seem interested. mango juice works great for constipation if your kids like the taste.
0	a famous tv doctor recommended using turffle sea salt on popcorn as a healthy snack. i tried this but just didn &apos;t like the taste. guess i am not a truffle lover. others may find this a wondeful product. it is a matter of taste , not anything else.
0	when i saw the ingredients on this box i knew it would be a disappointment. it would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. also , there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like pamela &apos;s and bob &apos;s red mill. this will be a huge disappointment to you so don &apos;t waste your money.
1	even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog.
0	i love all different types of beef jerky , but not this one. it has the flavor of grocery store bought beef jerky once you get over the overwhelming taste of salt. these sticks are cut thin making them tender and easy to chew , but they &apos;re just way too salty and definitely not worth $ 20
1	works great. seems to work wonders. lid is tight and some times hard to put on. when you get the hang of it easy. i &apos;ll buy again.
0	warning : it contains food preservatives. other than that it is fine , but presence of preservatives in dates ( ! ) justifies my low 2 star rating.
1	you just can &apos;t go wrong with peanut butter and jelly. these were so delicious. as with the apple cinnamon , i had a hard time keeping my gluten free fearing husband away from these ! yummy ! ! !
1	this stuff is outragous. it is simply the best olive juice on the market. i tried another brand and it did not come close to boscoli. this stuff is actually better than the olive juice that comes from the jar of olives. i would highly recommend this product.
0	i think the pocky did not get stored rightly. the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick , and doesn &apos;t taste as it should. many of them stick together , and whenever i want to split them up , it just becomes very messy. now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it.
0	this product comes off as natural but let &apos;s not forget people that canola oil is a horrible oil. and if it isn &apos;t stated as non-gmo than it is.
1	this is the coffee we crave in our house. it is a strong brew , yet not bitter. yuban is the best ground coffee we have tasted , yet.
0	i grew up on orange sodas and thought this might be like a &apos; healthy &apos; crush. that would be a no. of course , tangerine has a bit of a different taste than orange as it &apos;s that much sweeter. adding the carbonation to it just made it an unappealing fizzy , ultra sweet drink , not unlike cough syrup. proceed with caution. perhaps kids would find it super tasty.
1	i love this ! such a great product for all us gluten free folks ! it works the same as the regular bisquick. their website has tons of gf recipes too ! this makes delicious pancakes and &apos; magic crust &apos; pies. yummy !
1	my kitties love these. other goodlife treats are good. kitties adore these. beg and plead for them. i think they must be addictive for cats.
1	i &apos;ve been drinking green mountain &apos;s dark magic and really enjoyed it , however i wanted a change. after some searching i discovered this coffee and am glad i did. it &apos;s got an excellent deep flavor that i really enjoy. strong enough - yet not overpowering. i recommend you give it a try.
0	this product was way to easy for our 4 month old pup raisin. the compartments opened up very easily with each nudge. it does serve well as a puppy food / snack bowl if your pup eats too fast - making him move from compartment to compartment to eat will slow him down. not great for trying to improve or test your puppy &apos;s iq , but a fun way to feed him.
0	i am not a coffee snob but craved coffee when i am pregnant , so i ordered some decaf. i have to say i never touched again and its not worth the trouble ( not much of course ) of making it
0	very surprised. expected it to be thicker. my 8 month olds are not pickey eaters but they refused to close thier mouths while this food was is there. i would try it from babies r us before buying in bulk here.
1	this is by far the best k-cup hot cocoa we have tried. it has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a k-cup , it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. highly recommend !
0	it is ok soup , but i expected more , as i love lobster bisque and tried so many different kinds in different places. this one is very watery and i could not find any lobster there. i guess it is ok for the price , but i would never buy this brand of the lobster bisque again.
1	don &apos;t buy just a few of these ! i order these by the case. i can &apos;t even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite.
0	this huge bag of chocolates contained old ( white and cracked ) chocolates that were completely melted all over the inside of the bag ! noone at work would even touch them since they looked so sad and gross ... what a waste and disappointment ! will be wary to ever purchase from this seller again
1	i received this item on time. the packaging was great. the gluten free bisquick is a great addition to our gluten free pantry.
0	my dog figured this out really fast and likes it a lot. however , it &apos;s over priced since my dog can get to the treats fast and he &apos;s a fast eater. i would suggest investing in a treat ball instead. that &apos;ll keep there attention longer and they are similarly priced.
1	very smooth rich flavor even on the largest setting , dark blend a very satisfying cup of coffee. i will recommend this to my friends. this product arrived on time well packaged.
1	i bought this -4 pack of dove deep wash and three months later i am still using it. i dont think i could use any other product.
1	oh , i love these chips ! and they &apos;re so hard to find where i am , and when i do find them , they &apos;re usually $ 1-2 more per bag for less. great that these are so cheap here at amazon.
1	received the order very fast. the lids are a little hard to get on. but they work fine. it &apos;s a good way to use your own brand of coffee if you like.
0	i used quotes around the word tea because i doubt that the bags contain tea. i wouldn &apos;t be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea. i would not give this product a single star ; it deserves zero stars in my opinion. this tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
0	i bought two kinds of davidson &apos;s bulk teas , darjeeling and gunpowder green , and i was very disappointed in the quality. they both make kind of a murky harsh tea. the darjeeling is very light in color and has an aftertaste more like pekoe. the gunpowder green is weak and flat. i certainly wouldn &apos;t recommend them.
1	the sugar was sweet , that can not be denied. as advertised , it didn &apos;t melt when baked either. however , it will not do for your liege waffles / gaufres what the larger pebbles of belgian pearl will do. these grains are smaller , think pretzel salt , or seed pearls.
1	full bodied tea , no loss of flavor even though it is decaffeinated. comes stored in its own heavy duty zipper plastic bag to ensure freshness during shipping. a great value for a good tea.
1	these are great beans for the price. if you live in a big city , however , i &apos;d suggest buying green beans at a local ethiopian shop or even a community coop. i also remember a pea berry out of east timor that was outstanding , but this tanzanian pea berry is comparable to standard beans.
1	so being gluten free is hard , especially in a dorm. but i have gotten really good at making gluten free pancakes on an electric frying pan. they are super yummy ! i also make these really yummy cheesy garlic biscuits. this stuff is heaven sent ! makes food that is reminiscent of &quot; normal food &quot;
1	this was great - so soft , so tasty. better than expected. perfect loaf every time.
1	the gevalia breakfast blend is perhaps the best coffee i have ever purchased. it is full-bodied , without being bitter. it also is much cheaper to purchase through amazon - with free shipping for prime members. cant &apos; beat it.
0	i have a yorkie ( 4 lbs ) so i got the extra small one. not a single doggie-bite-size treat could come out from where it supposed to , and that was me trying to get the treats out ... so , don &apos;t bother with this toy , your dog is only gonna drool all over from smelling that toy.
1	i am a saba fan. it is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings , dips , etc is without equal. use your imagination for this fruity / astringent addition. the only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution.
0	being a salt-free product is why i purchased this , but the chips are quite greasy.
0	three generations in our home tried this product and unfortunately , none of us liked it.
0	this time , forget ordering through amazon. you can get the same product , 24 k-cups for $ 12.75 at big cat or for $ 14.80 at keurig. these prices are a rip off.
1	when we lived in omaha we fell in love with pears coffee. i was thrilled to find it on amazon. for the price there is really no comparison. we &apos;ve tried other flavors , but always end up going back to colombio supremo. we are now on direct ship every three months with amazon. try it .. it &apos;s better than the grocery store options and less expensive.
0	this is the third popchips box i ordered on amazon. the box in the box was crushed by a toaster , the chips are really no more fun to eat.
1	i used to always go to jamba juice for the match green tea shots ... after trying this iced green tea powder i was hooked. this flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea. i don &apos;t mind the funny green color ... after all it &apos;s green tea.
0	i had heard quite a bit about the pb2 , and being a lover of peanut butter , i thought i would try it. but , it just didn &apos;t do the trick. taste was not what i like , though the consistency was ok. i prefer better &apos;n peanut butter.
1	excellent service &amp; price for the product , order shipped quickly &amp; received in good condition. will be ordering again as long as the price stays this good. you really can &apos;t beat the price.
0	i looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa , but was very disappointed with the flavor. it has an awful aftertaste , like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. also kind of weak , even on the smallest cup setting.
1	i heard of these through my weight watchers magazine. they a had a $ 5 coupon code so i figured &quot; what the heck ! &quot; . wow -- pop chips are amazing - every flavor is awesome ! i particularly liked the salt &amp; pepper. if you want crunch and flavor - these are for you ! !
0	i don &apos;t understand why this is priced so high. you can get it from walmart online for about $ 10.00 ( this includes shipping &amp; handling ) the product itself is great. i like the fact that i can control how much flavor i get by adjusting the amount of powder i use. basically the product is 5 stars &amp; the cost is 1 star.
0	i found these finally and was quite disappointed. they are ok at best , nothing like potato chips though ..
0	i was so hoping she would like this because it is so healthy and would be easy to take camping and out to dinner ... but she wouldn &apos;t eat any of it and kept spitting it out. i gave it to the dogs and they loved it and i am sure it is healthy for them !
0	i have to agree with the other reviewer. this is truly the worst tasting beverage i have ever tried. i could not even finish one can. i threw it away. complete waste of money.
1	i read the other reviews before purchasing am pleased that i did. i have purchased other numi teas and gave generally been happy with all of theri products.
0	check out soap.com for the same sugar , same quantity ( 2 8oz boxes ) for 7.49. also just fyi a belgian reviewed it and said this is not authentic and that it makes the waffle chewier.
0	the quality of the pumpkin itself is quite good. however , it was just shipped out in the warehouse carton and all of the cans were badly dented. i won &apos;t order this item again.
1	this is the best way to cook a roast. our local grocery went out of buisness and so i could not find this product till i looked here. please continue to keep this product available !
0	product was never received nor money returned. four requests have been ignored. i will probably never again order anything through twang or from amazon. also , i will spread the word about these sites.
0	this tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn &apos;t taste very chocolatey. the name brand cocoa kkups are better , or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better.
1	i love buying these and drinking them after my workout. you lose not just fluids but minerals / vitamins and this helps replenish you. water is good too for you too but i just love these post-workout. they are also good for anytime when you could use a sweet but natural drink ( like you don &apos;t want milk or soda or water but want something tasty and refreshing ) .
0	i am only drinking it , so it won &apos;t be wasted , and i have to rotate it with a coffee people product , so i remember why i like coffee. it is really wan. the strongest flavor profile is tin. i love creme caramel and am a huge wp fan , but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. choose another - you won &apos;t be sorry you did.
1	i &apos;m very happy with this-- drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively. works better for me than guaifenisen.
0	i had high hopes of this being delicious but was very disappointed in the flavor and texture. it felt slimy on my tongue and the flavor was not even close to tasting like any ranch dressing i &apos;ve ever had. i threw them away : (
0	too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
0	the ingredients shown on pamela &apos;s website did not show any corn in the mix. the package lists corn derivatives in the mix. my grandson is allergic to corn , so this is a problem.
1	these make a good and very filling lunch with a little bit of lemon juice squeezed over them.
0	old , stale , must have been in the warehouse a very long time. i bought four boxes. one for myself and three for gifts .... poor choice.i do not recommend this product. this turkish delight was not ...
0	i wish amazon would require any coffee with sweet artificial flavorings to be plainly identified as such. then folks who really dislike coffee adulterated this way could avoid getting another disappointing flavored cup of coffee. this stuff tastes the way i imagine newman &apos;s own extra bold coffee would taste with curdled , spoiled bailey &apos;s irish cream dumped in it - nasty. shudder ! ! !
1	at my local costco store , i bought pace salsa numerous times. the salsa tastes feel rich and i love the jalepenos pace puts in the salsa. spicy , but not too the point where i &apos;m sweating and can &apos;t enjoy my salsa and chips. the salsa doesn &apos;t feel watered down and this is a great &quot; go to &quot; salsa choice.
1	we received this order in perfect condition. i purchased this product for my mother-in-law. she likes the convenience of the product in the keurig coffee maker. the chocolate does not stick to the sides of the cup like the cheap hot chocolate in the paper bags. overall it tastes pretty good. it is a little weak but good. use only on the small cup setting in the keurig. 4 stars.
1	i couldn &apos;t find this product in the store. i love the size and the price was just right. love the promptness of the delivery.
0	after waiting 40 days i still have not received this product and i have now missed christmas. not enough staff was the reason for the delay. never again amazon !
0	dear sirs , it didnt work for me , i have made yogurt at home using milk , yogurt and leaving overnight for 13 hours protected from cold without using yogurt machine.yours didnt work , i followed instructions and doesnt get any firmness. thanks a lot enrique
0	my dog loves these treats but we recently found out these are made in china. chicken jerkey products from china need to be avoided. i threw out the rest of these as a result. stay away and buy something american made.
1	very good product , will purchase over and over again. a convenient way to purchase.
1	i bought these and yes they do come in plastic bags with a label on each but also included was a five sided box that you can fold together that has a picture of each flavor , one on each side. it makes a cute little colorful box , nice to give as a gift if you put it together.
0	this does not work on windows 7 , tried reinstating software and to no surprise it din &apos;t work. this was a waste of time and money. be aware of this issue.
0	i didn &apos;t care for this drink at all. it &apos;s almost like eating a sweettart in liquid , carbonated form. my husband and oldest daughter felt the same way , but my 13 year old liked it. it is 100 % juice though , which is nice to see in a carbonated beverage.
1	this product is very good but i have this feeling that it is rather highly priced. i don &apos;t know why gluten free products in general are very expensive when they are made from easily available ingredients.people with gluten problem are not just &quot; eating healthy &quot; but are sick and should not be exploited. i like the muffins particularly when they are toasted.
1	thank you for this product - we use it all the time and appreciate your promptness and the price was excellent. thanks again.
1	cant find this flavor in the stores , so bought them here online .. like them so much better than the peppermint ones ... i also like the cinnamon ones ... yum-o ( as rachel ray states ) ...
1	dynasty brand green tea is the best green tea i &apos;ve ever tasted. it never tastes stale , unlike brands i &apos;ve bought in grocery stores. this is because each tea bag is packed in a sealed envelope with a metallic lining. the metal apparently keeps out moisture.
1	grove square hot chocolate is very tasty. i was searching for the swiss miss brand and the search pulled up this one. the price was right so i ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at grove squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup koerig setting. you won &apos;t be disapointed
1	this is a great multi-use sauce. great for using as a baste when grilling - fish , chicken , shrimp , pork , etc.
1	this was a new product for our 2 &quot; kids &quot; ... they liked them so well we even thought of trying them ! great price , and obviously a new favorite !
1	popchips are an excellent snack. i really like all of the varieties. i use amazon &apos;s subscription plan and save some $ $ - i get 1 24-pack box per month , shipped automatically. life is grand !
1	we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill ( about 1 / 3 of the bag at a time ) . the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too. more importantly , the coffee is smooth ; no bitter aftertaste. on numerous occasions , we &apos;ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.
0	this egg pasta ingredient was &quot; powdered egg product &quot; and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing. i don &apos;t like anything powdered , but price was right. can &apos;t have it all i guess.
0	it isnt even wroth being sugar free. my stomach is aching and i am getting so much gas. i would rather stick with the normal werthers. i cant believe i bought 12 bags of this crap ...
1	i buy gosh that &apos;s good sugar free white velvet all of the time. this is the best sf white chocolate that i have ever used. it may be a little expensive but it lasts a long time. buy it and enjoy !
1	i am a chip addict and these are by far some of the tastiest , non-homemade chips i &apos;ve ever had. plus they &apos;re healthy ! only problem is i can &apos;t decide which flavor is my favorite.
0	saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. opened can. heated soup. tasted soup. dumped soup down drain. rinsed mouth with mouthwash. enough said.
0	not my idea of a good caramel. flavors of ginger and pistachio dominated. same for the chocolate walnut and orange honey varieties. i missed the mix of rich , buttery , dairy flavor with caramelized sugar that i expect in caramels.
1	these crackers are incredible. healthy and tasty - you can &apos;t go wrong. the italian and mexican harvest are my favorites. the cinnamon are great for breakfast with yogurt. buying the six pack allowed me to taste all to see which ones i would order again.
0	the taffy was not good. seemed to be old , somewhat sponge like. wrote to the company and have been taken care of. appreciate the good customer service. thanks
0	my girls seem to like this food - they &apos;ve only ever shown an opposition to green beans. but it is so messy. it &apos;s apparently tomato-based , and it gets everywhere. where we usually just wipe their faces gently , you really have to clean them. it simply turns their skin orange. and the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily , even after soaking.
0	these things are nothing like oreos.you think wow oreos. think again. i would say spend your money on something better ( the hershey &apos;s or reese &apos;s crisp wafer bars come to mind ) . my honest view on these &quot; thin crisps &quot; cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer , or milk bones.
0	horrible taste ! ! ! it does not even tastes nor smell like cinnamon , i have tried different brands and this is the worst ! ! ! ! !
0	i made the waffles and was not impressed. definitely not worth the expense ! it &apos;s only redeeming quality was that i seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops. i would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.
0	it &apos;s all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy , threw it out and made my own.
0	it is pricey and has high fructose corn syrup in it. i dont see why they dont make it more natural , is it really difficult to make it hfc free ?
0	my 12 month old lab puppy can grasp the bottle in her mouth and shake out all of the treats. it took her less than a minute to figure this out and eat all of the treats. i was very disappointed in this dog toy.
1	better than expected ! well packaged , moist , fresh and fragrant beans were just what i needed for my recipe. perfect. would not hesitate to order this bargain-priced , excellent product again.
1	this coffee was good but it had a distinctive aroma and taste like buttered movie theater popcorn. i am a huge hazelnut flavored coffee fan and this was good , it just doesn &apos;t typically taste like hazelnut. you may like it but i will search for a more true hazelnut flavor. do a test , make popcorn in the microwave and then later make the coffee and you will see the similarities.
1	these are guaranteed to be a hit with my kids - like regular gummy bears , but even better - with extra flavor. perfect consistency .... not too chewy ... great all the way around.
1	i love the cups - i have reviewed this before and said the same thing. saving a lot of money using these kups.
1	we &apos;ve been using walnut oil for many years ; we brush it on toast to take the place of butter , eliminating much of the saturated fat from our diets. it &apos;s also wonderful in salads--try it tossed into greens with a few nuts and chopped stone fruit or grapes , and a fruity vinegar. this product is of excellent quality and amazon has a great price for it.
1	bought these to give out as party favors for my son &apos;s baseball themed birthday party. they were a huge hit with both the adults and children.
1	only pom.mol.i &apos;ve ever used but this seemed to have the same flavor the chef came up with for a pomegranate relish for fish. it seems to have a bit of a brown appearance though where the one the chef used was a brighter red color.
0	i &apos;ve ordered this several times. each time it arrives with the bottom 1 / 3 of the package just dust. for this price i would think the majority of the bag would be whole pieces. i &apos;ve complained several times , but nothing changes. they don &apos;t ship it any more carefully and it comes 1 / 3 dust.
0	i have enjoyed this product for quite some time. however , i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing ! at $ 35 per case , customers are paying more than $ 4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous ! i will find a healthier , more reasonably priced snack to munch on. shame on nana and amazon. . .
1	i have tried about every k cup brand .... caribou mohogany is my all time go-to brand. flavorful yet not strong and no jitters. you get the same great flavor whether you make a small cup or a large one.
0	my dog is very smart , he got the idea of what he needed to do real quickly but it &apos;s just to hard for the treats to come out of the jar , even when we help him ... the rope pretty much closes the jar hole and the treats wont come out. this toy made my puppy real nervous and unfortunately i &apos;m returning it , even though i was super excited about it ! : (
1	my 4yo cardigan welsh corgi loves these things , and when they stopped carrying them at petsmart , i had to go here for them. they seem to be made of good ingredients , and they &apos;re the right size for him. plus , he loves them and that &apos;s what &apos;s important !
1	since husband quit smoking many many yrs ago , he took up the tic-tac habit with cinnamon tic-tacs. they no longer make cinnamon so he has tried the wild cherry and they are ok.
1	i have always trusted the bisquick name , so i decided to buy this product. i was thrilled with the pancakes and muffins i was able to make. the only thing i have a problem with is the size of the box. it &apos;s very small. like most gf product , you pay much more than you would for the non-gf counterpart. : (
0	unfortunately the hershey bars arrived melted and i had to throw them out. the special &quot; packing &quot; was completely melted and , naturally , did not preserve the candy. it was a somewhat expensive lesson for me to learn. i did notify the seller but never heard back from anyone.
0	this coffee was extremely weak and did not taste well. i do not recommend wasting your money on it.
1	tried the disposable k-cups and they work great , just as good as keurig k-cups. put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems. they couldn &apos;t be any easier to use. will continue to use them.
1	at it &apos;s best. i have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered. i &apos;ve tried plain chamomile and it didn &apos;t make the cut. nothing beats a cup or two of sleepy time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy. what a perfect way to drift off into slumber !
0	was awful. the sight of this in my pan made me sick ... smells like potato duh potato starch ) ... would not brown. my child laughed the entire time ... as i complained because i was so hungry and thought i could have a late night pancake session. totally not the case. yes , i am a gf newbie ... i tossed the box !
0	i was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. this is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. i prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. adding milk didn &apos;t help much. i guess mom spoiled me ( good ) .
1	i used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that i made. it worked out so well. bride &amp; groom were very happy and got non-stop compliments ! !
0	was looking forward to this drink but was put off by its sweet soda-like taste. maybe it &apos;s an acquired taste ? i &apos;m not sure but the high calories don &apos;t make me want to try. looking forward to a diet version.
1	great option for excellent taste , price , and convenience. a repeat customer on these ! we order these now in the 36 pack instead of getting at the grocery store.
1	we had previously tried another brand of hot coca k-cups. we bought these since they seemed to be a pretty good value. we actually like the taste and flavor of these more than the other brand we tried. they have just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness. we like the variety of flavors in the pack also.
1	he never has enough juice left over from his jar of olives , we therefore end up with more olives then we can eat , just buying the juice makes alot of sense.
1	my daughter lives in hawaii and sent me some great coffee from there. i have a keurig and was not sure how to use the new coffee. i got these fast fast and now am using my hawaiian coffee. great product.
1	my family really enjoys grove square hot cocoa milk chocolate and we keep a supply on hand. the excellent price is what made us choose this brand but the taste is what makes us continually renew our order.
0	so excited to order these ... received them they were okay , little to light for my taste. then discovered most coffee &apos;s were going to expire the following week &amp; all others were going to expire within 20 days. really ? how are you going to sell me old coffee. thank god i was able to get a refund
1	this is the best iced green tea i &apos;ve ever had ; the hint of blueberry is just perfect. i add a bit of stevia for a little more sweetness. it would be an insult to call this &quot; instant tea , &quot; but i carry a packet in my purse because it &apos;s better than any prepared tea i could buy when eating out. stash tea is always good , but this is extraordinary.
1	wow , i like the flavors ! i &apos;ve tried the apple pie , mint ice cream and the strawberry shortcake ( not too fond of this one .. ) but the others are great ! i love the apple pie and this key lime pie it says hydrogenated starch ... not oils .. difference ?
0	was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday. seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them &apos; safe &apos; . : - (
0	the ener-g english muffins that i received from amazon were not of the same quality when i buy them directly from the distributor in seattle. they crumbled and had dense places that were not really edible. also , there were only 4 in the pack instead of 6. i had to cancel my recurring order.
0	the product is a good value for the amount you get , however it is way too salty. the product is very dry and firm. i think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half.
0	please do not send the salmon as baby will no eat it , please send the chicken on happybaby organic baby food. i am to received this once a month. marlene layman
1	my dog &apos;s love it. made from excellent ingredients and a great price at amazon.com. my chihuahua has allergies and i &apos;ve noticed she isn &apos;t scratching or chewing on her paws anymore.
1	these pancakes just hit the spot and make me feel like i am eating a restaurant breakfast at home for a lot less money. splurge on this and the good maple syrup ... it really is cheaper than going to denny &apos;s or ihop where a meal for two will be $ 20 minimum.
0	i was sadly disappointed in this brand of assam tea. once properly brewed , the tea was weak. when i brewed another pot , i added more tea , in the hopes of making it drinkable. the second pot was weak , and bitter.
0	before you purchased the product , make sure you know that this cereal has a very strange smell. this is the normal smell of the product. i don &apos;t know how to describe the smell , but be careful with your choice. my baby doesn &apos;t like the smell.
1	bought this mix along with the cuisinart waffle maker. delicious. we followed the directions and it made only one belgian waffle. the next time we doubled the recipe and it came out the right amount. good flavor and easy to use.
0	i was relatively unimpressed as well as disappointed given the product was melted and many of the pieces were damaged upon delivery.
0	i wish i had read the product description better .... i didn ; t realize this was sweetened ... i do not like the sweetened teas ... now i am stuck with 2 orders of them .... but the other green tea powder is great.
1	i am a middle aged runner and take this cherry concentrate to help my recovery time between long races. this works better than ibuprofen and is all natural. after each long run i take a couple tablespoons with my gatorade and my muscles recover quicker ( i experimented with not taking it ) . i love this stuff.
1	the ingredients are really wholesome. and , fast delivery ! it would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though. but my dog loves them and will buy again !
1	we ordered this on our doctor &apos;s recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement. it &apos;s supposed to have several omega acids.also tasty on salads.
0	i have greyhounds and when they grabbed the rope and the bottle &quot; chased &quot; them rattling ( kibble inside ) they decided they would never touch it again. i try it again with each new foster , and they all do the same thing ...
1	i &apos;ve always wanted to like coconut water - low in calories , high in minerals - but i &apos;ve just never liked the taste much. the pineapple juice in this really makes a difference. it still needs to be well chilled to be good , but it makes a healthy post-workout drink.
0	my dogs love the biscuits but too bad most times all they get are small pieces. calls to the company get a useless answer of not their fault. obviously bad quality control.
1	i make a bowl of mccann &apos;s every morning in the little crockpot for my breakfast ; add a banana , and it &apos;s perfect ! ! try it and you &apos;ll never eat &apos; the other stuff &apos; again ! !
0	i found the taste a bit on the strong side and while it was definitely seafood flavored i could not distinguish what seafood. it is still passable though and the portions are large enough for 2.
1	my husband is a beer nut lover. looked in many stores and could only find small bags. love these large cans.
0	very disappointed with the taste of this product ; it really lacks flavor.in the future i will wait until schluckwerder marzipan is back in stock.
1	i first tried this tea at at french restaurant that had ran out of the usual black tea with mint. to my surprise this tea beats any tea ( without milk ) .. no sugar needed. it is naturally sweetened !
1	these are a cheap alternative for summer when everyone wants a cold treat. superior flavor and size than the fla-vor-ice case.
1	i looked , i bought , i tried several different types of brewing cups. for the cost and quality , these are the best ! i can make a few ahead of time ... using my preferred brand of coffee. i &apos;ll , definitely , keep these in stock at my house !
1	this coffee tastes like a good cityroast coffee with a mild hazelnut flavor. it &apos;s good. i am a big fan of hazelnut , and i would like the flavor to be a little stronger. my husband loves the aroma of this one and he prefers it to the boyer hazelnut because it is a little darker roast than the boyer.
1	one of the best choices so far. if you like bold coffee you will like this one will definitely buy again
1	i am very pleased with this product. i almost did not buy them because they looked green on my computer , but when i received them they were the normal tan color that most of them are.
1	i have lots of ground coffee and since having my keurig have not been able to use it. but , with the disposable cups , i can use up all my ground coffee and get the tastes i want. i would buy again ; convenient. ( be sure you snap the lid on securely because it is a tight fit. )
1	love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill , great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank.
1	especially as we get older , the lining of our stomach gets more sensitive to harsh chemicals and substances. low acid coffee is a common sense substitute that loses no aroma or taste in the process. highly recommended.
0	this pumpkin is just wierd. it smells awful and is much looser than any other canned pumpkin. i thought all canned pumpkins were the same ..... so not the &quot; case &quot; . i really regret this purchase ! !
1	for those who do not drink coffee , this is a great compliment to the teas and ciders also available for your keurig.
1	this cereal is hard to find in local stores where i live. my wife and i love this cereal for its taste and healthfulness. whenever i find it in some hotel breakfast buffets , i am a happy man. i cannot think of eating any other cereal.
1	i have tried many different brands and flavors of k-cup coffees and i have to say , this one is one of the best i have ever had. i would strongly recommend it. it is very hard to find so buy it if you can get it at a good price.
1	i am very acustom to spicy foods and this has a very rich flavor. half the bottle was devoted to given people my &quot; not so hot salsa &quot; reactions amazing . worth the money ! as for me eating it the title says it all
1	we have been living gluten-free for 5 years now , and this mix is the best i have found ! it makes great waffles.
1	this spice can be tricky to get good quality and this one arrived quick and the flavors are spot on , use it to marinate fish or chicken then grill it , love it !
1	one of green mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion , love it for your everyday blend , perfect stregnth , excellent blend !
1	hello , i have tried some different foods for my dog , but this is the one she tolerates the best.i have a 13 year old border collie / lab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time now.she loves it.thank you.
1	very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful. my youngest daughter &apos;s dentist recommneds that she chew xylitol gum 3 to 4 times each day to help prevent cavities. her baby teeth had a cavity in every tooth along with three crowns ! ! ! ! her adult teeth seem to be much more cavity resistent and i believe the gum is helping prevent the cavities.
0	i ordered this in the past and was extremely disappointed. they are unlike truffles that i know of. they were hard like a huge seed , had no truffle aroma. i threw all contents out. will never order them again
1	disposakups - disposable k-cups for keurig brewers - 50 cups , lids , filters - 100 % disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill k-cups and then throw them out. i pre-fill them so all i have to do is put them in the machine.
1	this coffee has a more present flavor than the stuff they brew for us at work , yet it goes down smoothly. to my wife and i , that &apos;s a good combination. the fact that it comes already ground doesn &apos;t do anything to subtract the flavor either.
1	my yorkiepoo thrives on this dog food. i ran out two weeks ago , no local source , bought a competitor &apos;s so called equivalent only to see my quinn suffer from itching and belly aches. i ordered this from amazon yesterday , free shipping , they sent it out hours later and i recieved it today !
0	i was hoping bisquick got it right when they released this product , but they missed their mark. i made both biscuits and dumplings ( chicken &amp; dumplings ) . the biscuits came out okay but the flavor was bland. the dumplings were fluffy but not very flavorful and turned hard after a day or two.
1	this licorice has very good taste. my daughter is on a gluten free diet and she loves these cherry bites.
1	this coffee smelled wonderful while it was brewing. my husband drinks a lot more coffee than i do , and he agreed that this is a great tasting coffee. we are looking forward to trying melitta &apos;s other varieties.
0	i ordered the no sugar added version. i usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream , yogurt , hot chocolate etc. but this one was terrible. like the other reviewer , this tasted like ovaltine. i had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. i don &apos;t know what to do with 5 other cans .. i will probably donate ..
1	i had bought pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no asian stores i have to shop on the internet. the guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. for a bit of insanity , search for pocky commercials on youtube !
1	i used this flour in my usual pizza recipe. i noticed the difference with regular bread flour right away. the dough was very elastic and easy to work with. the pizza ended up being lighter and crispier than usual. i will only use his flour from now on !
1	this is the best tasting stevia powder i &apos;ve tried. most other powders have a weird after taste but this one doesn &apos;t. i recently bought a 5lb bag of it online and i &apos;m making my way through it.
0	ugh ... no where on the amazon page for this item did it state that it was hazelnut flavored. i have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it. thought it was going to be a blue mountain-like jamaican coffee ...
0	the lolipops were melted to the cellophane ( in february ) . each individual pop had &quot; oriental trading &quot; and a 1-800 phone # printed on the wrapper. i intended it as a gift and it was absolutely unsuitable. had to return.
1	i like newman &apos;s own for my family due to its consistent quality and good ingredients ; i like have the opportunity to provide the same quality products to my animals. amazon makes it convenient to get multiple bags in manageable sizes that appear on my front porch according to my schedule. i got the three four-pound bags ; talk about portability and storability !
0	quality is ok but if you need maltodextring in larger but not huge quantities , buy carbo gain from now foods. much better bang for the buck.
1	this is an excellent product for the non-gluten diet. they &apos;re good alone as a snack , or you can make a light meal with them by using these rice crackers as a base for spreads or little crispy sandwiches. excellent substitute for crackers containing gluten. only criticism - wish the price would come down.
1	the kelloggs muselix are delicious and the delivery was quick. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001e6kbsk &quot; &gt; kellogg &apos;s crispy blend mueslix raisins , dates &amp; almonds , 15.3-ounce unit ( pack of 5 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	apparently &apos; regular &apos; size = thinner than standard-sized pencils = ( my chihuahuas finish these in a matter of minutes , when it normally takes them days to consume a thicker bully stick.
0	i wasnt real thrilled with these , some were fine and some were stale. then again i have bought them in the store the same way ! they are more expensive in the store so buying in bulk meant i saved and dont have to hunt for them for a long time ! !
1	this product is very good. i have really been pleased. as usual of amazon , it arrived in good timely fashion. thank you.
0	the nuts were stale and tastless. i tried to get a refund but you said it could not be refunded. i threw them out.
0	i ordered this item because i thought it was freeze-dried kinda like dehydrated , but it &apos;s not ! they taste like they were pickled and rolled in sugar ! yuck ! the original strawberry taste is gone. the company sent them to me very promptly and in great packaging , but i really thought it was something else ... the page does not provide a good description of what the product really is.
1	these are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor. the bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price. so you get more of what you would normally pay for.
0	why in the world would amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested , when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. wish every state would wake up like california and ban all these cancer causing things.
1	if you want a quick pick me up that is not full of added sugar , then this is a refreshing alternative to a soda. the flavor is more heavily tangerine ( which only makes sense ) . it isn &apos;t overly sweet , which is a good thing.
0	serveice delivery with the seller was excellent. the product was not. will not order again. bad taste. iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes. i throw it right away , i coudl not drink it.
0	keebler townhouse olive oil crackers taste ok but are a waste of money when 80 % of minicrackers are broken into 1 &quot; pieces
0	at first glance i thought what a great deal , then i read some of the other reviews and looked a little closer. this claims that the regular list price is $ 51 for a 4 pound bag ? give me a break ! seriously , amazon ? ? ? ?
1	3 boxes , under $ 6 each for all cherry - great buy. i couldn &apos;t find all cherry in the store and don &apos;t really care for the other flavors.
1	this is really tasty hot chocolate. i like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference ...
1	we only feed our dog dry food , and it has to be good dog food. newman brands are high quality , and i can get it delivered on a periodic basis and a fixed price thru amazon. ginger likes it and it keeps her healthy. i have learned over the years that this man , and his company , are highly moral and deliver fine quality products they stand behind.
1	didn &apos;t have time to make these this year so i thought i would buy them. i never buy cookies , but these i would buy again. my son loved them. the only thing i had to do was dip them in white chocolate. thanks
1	i must say i was pleasantly surprised. i don &apos;t drink coffee and i was searching for more hot chocolates for my keurig. i am a milk chocolate fan , but with grove square the peppermint and dark chocolate are by far the better choice.both have a sweetness i wasn &apos;t expecting. the flavor is great and i don &apos;t want to share. i am definitely reordering more.
0	i got this on the warehouse deal so i wasn &apos;t expecting much. however , be advised you will get no regular donut shop and instead you will receive over half of the box as decaf. i love the flavors of all of these though , so that &apos;s ok. but i will think hard about getting another variety pack.
1	these chips are salty with a hint of sweet. they are crisp and crunchy. they are the best chips i &apos;ve ever had !
1	my son loved all the sauces. the only sauce that was way too hot was the insanity sauce , use a teensy tiny bit when using.
0	the chocolate is just as delicious as could be expected. the wrap is easy to remove and re wrap again. the kisses in the inside come in a nice bag , keeping them safe inside. the box it comes in is sturdy enough. i ordered two , one came intact and the other came demolished on one side ... very very disappointed.
1	we appreciate the short list of ingredients on the ghiradelli hot chocolate mixes. the chocolate mocha flavor is rich and chocolatey with out being overpowered by the coffee. this is one of our favorite cold weather drinks.
0	the taste is very good. problems i had were that this was european product so i had to figure how to convert to cups and ounces. although i like the taste and convenience , i will not purchase again because of expensive s &amp; h. i will look for this product locally unless it &apos;s offered by amazon on super saver.
1	mackerel is a tasty alternative to salmon with nearly the same omega 3 content. my local grocery store hasn &apos;t been able to get tinned mackerel for several months. no one can explain why. so i ordered a case of these and have been pleased with the quality and value. i &apos;m reordering.
1	yum ! all the convenience you expect with a k-cup with all the flavor of real hot chocolate. the kids love it , and so will you !
1	we really like this coffee , it has great flavor and we make it strong. we do the subscribe thing and it works out about right.
0	this is a very pretty container , and my granddaughter loved the blue color when mixed with water-- but--- it tastes more like coconut than chocolate-- should be labeled hot coconut drink.
1	i think this is the best dulce de leche i ever tried. i discovered at the llao llao hotel in bariloche ( argentina ) on a recent trip. they serve it at breakfast there.
1	these are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected , but perfect ; gives a boost to &quot; plain old &quot; pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt / vinegar chips ! ! ! in addition , the company is quite pleasant to deal with , and all the other products i &apos;ve tried are delicious and a good bargain , too.
1	these jelly beans are wonderful. they are smaller than regular jelly beans but that doesn &apos;t take away the flavor. i would recommand these to anyone.
1	the barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect ! just spicy enough , a hint of sweetness , just a little smokey. the chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial , but not hard. this makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers , hot dogs or brats , chicken or just about any casual entree.
1	i love jerk cooking , and this is the perfect jerk sauce to put over a freshly cooked piece of jerk chicken , pork , goat or beef. each bottle does not last long at our house.
1	roland red lumpfish caviar is excellent.the price is good and affordable , it makes a good presentation for company , and tastes very good. i purchased many items from amazon , even large ticket items , and i am very satisfied with the products and service.
0	i am a &quot; breakfast blend &quot; coffee drinker , so maybe this was just too strong for me , but i tried a cup black &amp; another cup with cream and sugar , and this coffee tasted terrible both times. i did like the low acid aspect , but i think they should try flavored versions.
1	a dream for those on weight watchers who love potato chips. the individual serving bags of pop chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
0	i don &apos;t have any dietary restrictions. i bought these because of an price reduction. i wouldn &apos;t purchase them again. they have very few chocolate chips. like you have to hunt for them in the cookie. that isn &apos;t what chocolate chip cookies should be about. the oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.
0	i love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other k-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable. wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging. i will not order again because of the waste.
1	i am absolutely amazed with the taste of this product. i &apos;m not too much of a fan of the caramel dip , but the syrup is equally as delicious as its pancake counterpart. i highly recommend it , but ask your local grocers to see if they &apos;re willing to carry it. this is far too expensive than what i paid going to my grocery store.
1	this was our first time trying popchips , but i had heard so many good things about them so i was eager to try them. we ordered the variety pack to try a few flavors. my kids gobbled all of them easily but their favorite was the salt and vinegar. my favorite by far is the bbq flavor. we love popchips here ! ! !
0	i just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received ! agree. i ordered the sea salt &amp; vinger packs and am very disappointed. ver weird vinegary awful taste. the salt and vinegar especially tasted gross ! i took one bite and had to throw the bag away. agrre. now i &apos;m stuck with a bunch of 23 bags of chips that i &apos;ll never eat.
1	these disposakups are &quot; the cats meow &quot; they serve the purpose thy were intended for very well and were delivered as promised on time and well packaged arrived in good condition i would recommend to all friends.
0	we bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then cafe escapes dark chocolate. it was also thinner in consistency. won &apos;t buy again
0	it came soggy but a few days in the fridge it harden up , it had a salty taste. love the size makes great snacks for kids school work snack
1	i love that i can get both flavors in one container. and at the asians store around where i &apos;m at they go for about a buck , sometimes more. so this is definitely a good deal and even cheaper when you subscribe and save
0	these are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece. if they were at my local grocery , i might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them. i didn &apos;t really like the flavor that well , but if you did , they might even worth up to fifty cents per can. otherwise , pass these up.
0	these are tasty enough for an emergency snack / lunch--i keep a few in my file cabinet. but our local meijer &apos;s sells them for $ 1.33 apiece. even the discount price here is twice that.
1	this product is great for growing cat grass. gives a hearty grass is easy &amp; fast growing. will purchase in the future.
0	i made this this past weekend and i am not a fan , its sweet and i had to check to make sure i didnt use the apple flavor one. its also very salty. just not a fan , and now what to do with the other 5 boxes i have , maybe try using half or something.
1	i can &apos;t believe these are actually decent for you. they taste awesome ! i love these chips , they have great crunch and a great amount of flavor. i am addicted to these and so is my boyfriend ( who hates anything that &apos;s healthy ) . i recommend these to all my friends. i &apos;m on the auto refill program but keep having to reorder early since my bf keeps eating them all.
0	i could not finish this drink , it is like drinking orange syrup. it may not have any added sugar in it but one can of 8.3 ounces has 34 sugar grams and 36 carbs. i &apos;ll stick to water when i want to quench my thirst !
1	i love plum organic pouch. got this one on sale. my baby and toddler love this so much. my 3 years old always ask me for more.
1	this is one of my son &apos;s favorite baby foods. it does have a bit of sweetness , but not too sweet. it &apos;s more runny than some of the other flavors , so we use a deeper spoon with this one , or add a little rice cereal to thicken it up.
1	everything americolor that i have purchased works great ! i was looking for some lighter tone colors , everything i had was pretty bright. these sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen , it &apos;s great ! thank you !
1	our ferret loves this rabbit ; it &apos;s a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular evo ferret diet. the price was reasonable compared to our local pet store , which doesn &apos;t often have this item in stock.
0	these chips are nasty. i thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag , no the chips were just soaked with grease. nasty ! !
1	i &apos;d continue to buy but i &apos;m moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars ... shattered too many. they like all the flavors though. great textures too.
0	first off , it leave a bad taste in our mouth. next dose not taste like any thing i ever had .and last it made us sick later that night . there &apos;s no use by date on it so it makes one wounder if it is out dated
1	my husband does not like whole wheat anything but he liked this pizza dough. it was very simple to make and spread on our pizza stone. we put rossi pizza sauce and mozzarella cheese on and it was great !
1	i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it ! i haven &apos;t made anything with it yet , just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent ! it &apos;s dark , syrupy , sour , and a little sweet. a dab of this and i forget about dessert. it &apos;s just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. yum ! ! i &apos;m going to try making fesenjan next : - )
1	i first tasted this at petrossian. i had ordered green tea and when i tasted it , i was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea. i noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic. it complimented the tea very well. the tea is very light. au bon pain also carries this tea. try it out !
1	these are the only organic grahams i can find for a reasonable price. we love these and amazon makes them a perfect affordable snack for my toddlers.
0	i was disapointed in this salt. since it is a truffle salt i expected to taste at least a hint of truffle but didnt. if you want a really good truffle flavored salt order fusion black truffle salt it has a wonderfully strong aroma and great flavor !
1	i bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. the have commented back several times that it &apos;s the best popcorn they have ever had. they love it ! they had shopped in the dc metro area to find white popcorn and could never find it so one look on amazon was all it took to find this -- the best popcorn ever ! !
1	i just purchased a kurig and this was one of the first k cups i bought i still use it but if it was decaf would be better than id rate it five starts
1	i bought this color for a cake replica of the stanley cup that i made. i was using this color for the very first time and i have to say that it was perfect ! i was afraid that the silver would be too dark or matte , but it had a sheen and was exactly what i was hoping for.
0	i ordered this product because of a good price deal. amazon shipped accordingly , absolutely no problems there. however , the taste of this product was horrendous. it tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it. i personally will go back to buying swiss miss in a can and just using the keurig to give me hot water , cheaper and much better tasting.
1	i finally have found a natural sugar substitute that has the added benefit of having a low glycemic index. agave is delicious ! i have recommended it to many friends , and it is very economical to purchase the 46oz bottles.
1	this is a huge supply of them. i &apos;m still working on these and have plenty to spare. much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint.
1	this stuff worked out great for my disco ball birthday cake. my customer loved it ! check it out &#91; ... &#93; if you are looking for a great way to add that little extra something for your treats , you found it.
0	i expected to receive medium roast coffee beans , but instead i received very light roast beans. they were medium to light browns in color. the acidity was more than what i would endure. i would not recommend this to anybody.
0	the lime flavor is too much , didnt think it would be so strong. its ok but there are much better flavors to be had. would not buy again.
0	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001eq5m3y &quot; &gt; sadaf pitted prunes black , 12-ounce packages ( pack of 4 ) &lt; / a &gt; this item was full of mold ( fungus ) on reciept !
0	i thought it would have a clean , crisp taste , but it honestly tasted just like every other orange soda i &apos;ve ever had. maybe that &apos;s deliberate ; maybe they &apos;re targeting people who would otherwise drink orange soda , unless presented with a more &quot; natural &quot; alternative ... regardless , it tastes exactly like carbonated reconstituted juice concentrates , with some orange coloring thrown into the mix , i.e. , nothing special.
1	i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon. the raincoast trading co. salmon is very tasty , equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland. however , the raincoast arrived in perfect condition , the kirkland cans were dented badly. i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon.
0	i don &apos;t know if i got a bad batch or what. about 1 / 4 of the bag doesn &apos;t pop and the flavor is absolutely horrible. the smell of the unopened bags is putrid like it is very old and rotted. i bought 2 boxes to give as christmas gifts and am extremely disappointed with my purchase.
0	we have ordered this coffee on several occasions and have been happy with the it. the most recent order seemed lacking in quality. it was bitter and disappointing.
0	i have had good luck with fee brothers for other mixers , but this orgeat is very bland. not much flavor at all. yep , if i had read the ingredients i wouldn &apos;t have bought it ... artificial flavors. good orgeat shouldn &apos;t be that obscure , but it has gotten hard to find. important for many of the &quot; tiki &quot; drinks.
1	comical that this is considered a &apos; toy &apos; . i bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. i used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table. lots of compliments. i have kept them and plan to use again for future parties. these will not be consumed so no idea how they taste ...
0	the product was good but the service was slow. i ordered two extracts and the shipping and handing was $ 7.95 and it took over two weeks to get the product. i even contacted the vendor and didn &apos;t receive a reply. not what i thought i was paying $ 7.95 for and i would bring your business someplace else.
0	ive been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try. this one was very sinue and a little too sweet for my taste. not going to buy again. im still on my search for the salty dry version im after
0	i bought this expecting the &quot; powdered &quot; form as it specified and ended up paying for a product i cannot use. the two , granulated ( which this is ) and powdered ( which it clearly is not ) are not interchangeable within recipes. i felt like i was tricked into buying the wrong product !
0	this product is not what we &apos;d hoped for at all. it was way too easy for our dogs to figure out. if you have a dog with any sort of intellect , choose something else !
1	japanese sweet but strong black coffee candy. lasts a long time in your mouth and costs alot less on amazon than elsewhere. made with real caffeinated coffee for a little energy.
1	i love to eat pasta but totally clueless on how to make one ... saw this while at the grocery earlier , decided to try it , followed the instructions and viola ... one awesome dinner ! ! note : i did add some parmesan and romano cheese to add more flavor ..
1	my husband loves strong caribou coffee but i like the milder one or &quot; breakfast type. i will drink this but caribou of all kinds is a great coffee , no matter how strong. it will not disappoint.
0	chips ahoy , chewy oatmeal cookies are so moist that it is difficult to separate a single cookie from the package without it breaking into pieces. my tastebuds say they are too sweet , not cooked enough , lack ample chocolate chips and oatmeal flakes. if you like cookie dough , you most likely will enjoy these. i &apos;ll stick with a crunchy , less sweet cookie.
1	these are the best sunflower seeds ever the bigger size makes them easier to eat. load of flavor in every bag !
1	these energy chews are absolutely delicious ! they hold up really well in your pocket or backpack when you &apos;re backpacking or mountain biking ! i really couldn &apos;t imagine eating any other energy chew ever again !
0	i use half a bag of seasoning but i still get thirsty afterwards , perhaps it has very high concentrate of msg.
1	this is the favorite green tea in our household. been using it for years. was happy to find it here on amazon , otherwise we had to travel about forty miles to an oriental grocery store to purchase it. can &apos;t even buy any leaf tea of any kind in regular grocery stores any more. by the way &quot; ban cha &quot; in japan simply means common or everyday tea. not ceremonial.
1	we love grilling all year long but can not get this in markets the price is great and they ship fast now i can get them year round with no salt
1	the only complaint i have with pop chips is that i can &apos;t get all of the flavors at the stores where i live ! ! ! my husband and i both love pop chips , his favorite is the salt and pepper and mine is the sour cream and onion. pop chips are a perfect mix between a chip and a rice cake ! ! ! ! we cannot say enough good things about them !
0	thought i &apos;d try these because it &apos;s a good price , but the chocolate flavor is not that good. and the sucralose taste is very strong. i like the swiss miss hot chocolate ones better , even though those have sucralose too , you can &apos;t really taste it.
1	i didn &apos;t mean to order a 40-pound bag. but i did. wow. that &apos;s a lot of food. be sure to mix it with protein or else you dog will suffer a bit of internal distress.
0	product has a shelf life of two years and was labeled as produced in december of 2009. product leaked from seal in carton.
1	i received this chips in a gift basket and absolutely loved them. i searched high and low , but was unable to find them until i saw them here. i immediately ordered a case. these chips are light , crispy , flavorful , and good for you. i love them with dip , in chili , or just plain. once you try them , you &apos;ll be hooked !
1	these coffee holders are much easier to use than the others i have used and make life a little easier !
0	i don &apos;t know why everyone loves these chips. they are healthy but taste disgusting. only the original flavor tasted good , so getting the variety pack was a very bad idea. i would not buy this again and would rather go with baked chips than these. pirate &apos;s booty makes popped chips that are way better.
0	would give this a zero if i could. i spent a lot of money for crackers and i believe some production error happened. every single bag was sealed incorrectly. i should say - not sealed or half way sealed - all 4 boxes only had the hermetic sealing to about 80 % - rest was open. all 4 boxes were entirely inedible. i was shipped 4 boxes of expensive stale crap.
1	mueslix has been my favorite cereal since it came out years ago. however , they have ( improved ? ? ? ? ) it by adding more raisins and nuts to the point of making it too rich ! i simply add about half of a grain cereal , such as cornflakes which also reduces the high price. stores keep discontinuing mueslix to the point that it is hard to find ! thank you amazon !
0	this is a good product , especially for iced coffee , but why is it twice the price as it is in stores ? this isn &apos;t a fluke--within the past two months i &apos;ve bought it for $ 5 a jar in seattle and in nevada , so it just looks like good old-fashioned gouging. try harder amazon.
0	bought the big box to be economical .. bad choice. my dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months. i gave them to a friend. my friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these , so i &apos;m not sad that my dog didn &apos;t like them.
1	excellent product. crab cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during christmas holidays for over 40 years. local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy / minced crab meat which is ok but not as satisfatory as lump style.
1	of the many purchses i made on amazon this past december , i was most pleased with the pocky chocolate cream covered biscuit sticks ( pack of 10 ) . they arrived on time , and they were a &apos; hit &apos; as a surprised gift. be sure to keep them refridgerated.
1	this was a great bargain , worked out cheaper than if i had purchased them at a wholesale discount store plus it was elegible for free shipment ... bonus
1	these taste great and have a great texture. our 2-year-old has little interest in eating fresh vegetables , but she loves these. she actually prefers these over goldfish crackers or other products of dubious nutritional value ! to me , that fact is worth the expense -- it is worth the cost to get her to eat vegetables.
0	i don &apos;t understand why pamela &apos;s has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their bread mix. if i wanted a sweet bread i would add my own sugar ! this is not a bread to have eggs and ham with. it taste more like a dessert. there are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there. don &apos;t waste your money on this one.
0	this flavor is horrible. there are many other flavors much better. hawaiian hazelnut is great ! breakfast in bed is awesome !
1	it says on the box each drink contains : the potasium of 2 bananas &amp; more electrolites than a sports drink. they might seem a little high priced but go to groecery store buy 2 bananas &amp; 2 sports drinks and you will pay more to get the same nutrition you get from 1 juice box of this coconut water ...
0	this tin must have been sitting on the shelf for a decade ; it was totally dried out when i opened it. when treacle sponge pudding dries , it smells nasty and can &apos;t be reconstituted , even with water and some heat. total waste of money.
1	i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
1	gevalia is the best coffee there is - always mellow , never bitter. i &apos;d never drink any other brand.
1	using the entire sauce packet is over kill , leaving a salty greasy puddle at the bottom of the carton. otherwise noodles are well made , and sauce is reasonably well flavored. quick and easy , a no brainer.
1	i have been using this product for years and was happy to find it on line since our local place ( bristol farms ) had closed. i love it especially in my salad dressings.
1	love this pasta. i mix this with regular pasta for a meal , half and half. love the lower calories and the fiber content.
1	of all the flavors i have tried of these bars , the peanut butter and jelly is my favorite ! everyone loves peanut butter and jelly and it is just as delicious as a bar !
1	they &apos;re almost gone already , and i &apos;m about 5 pounds heavier , but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores--if and when you can find an outlet that carries them ! yum !
0	i drink 10 cups a day of verona , italian , or french roast coffee , and wanted to try a lower-acid version. this brand of coffee smells and tastes like vinegar. it is totally unpalatable and you are better off drinking water if the acid in coffee bothers you.
0	this stuff was awful. it tasted like water soaked in cherios-except the cherios had a better flavor. this mud had no coffee aroma or flavor ! my stomach was still aching so i really dont know how low acid or decaf this sewage was. as an unexpected bonus i also got a terrible headache.what a bunch of crap !
0	i had high hopes when i purchased this produce , shipping was amazingly fast and i &apos;ve tried it a few times. i don &apos;t enjoy the taste , and since i don &apos;t sweeten my tea , it wasn &apos;t that great , and it did nothing for my sinuses. will not purchase again but i do recommend the seller.
0	love honey stinger gels , but not these. too sweet. the almond and cherry flavors are better than peanut butter , but i like saltier peanut flavors.
0	the price was comparable to walmart for same size product. however these nuts were not as crunchy ; and they needed a little more salt.
1	a dark coffee that has no bitterness and is smooth as silk. always use quality filtered water and a clean coffee maker if you want a great brew !
0	soybeans ? ! the whole attraction to cooking with duck fat ( besides the flavor ) is that it &apos;s a natural , healthy animal fat. why on earth does this product need to contain soybeans ( processed , not healthy ) ? oh that &apos;s right , because the government subsidizes soybean farms and so soybean products must now appear in everything americans eat. reprehensible.
1	my boyfriend tried these gummy bears at our favorite frozen yogurt place and said they were the best gummy bears ever. i sued them to tell me what kind they were and found them on amazon. then bought a 5 lb. bag of them for him haha. he wanted to go get frozen yogurt every other day just for the gummy bears. anyway , they are really flavorful gummy bears !
0	ugh , this stuff may be good for me but it &apos;s not appealing. i mixed it in my oatmeal for a while , and it was fine that way ( but sticky ) . but i didn &apos;t notice any obvious effect and i &apos;ve slacked off.
1	well one of my friends asked for a really big bag of gummy bears , she was very pleased when she opened the box. than her co-worker really like these gummy bears to.
1	i &apos;m going to guess that &apos; yuck &apos; didn &apos;t mix it up right , because , frankly , these taste surprisingly good considering they &apos;re supposed to be lo-carb. they &apos;re easy to make , and the non-diabetic in the house thinks they &apos;re just as tasty as i do. i do agree that the price is pretty outrageous , though.
0	these singles sell for $ 2.50 - $ 3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. i &apos;m not sure why amazon is selling it for $ 9.99 for a box of 24 singles. hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite , but truly this is not a good buy.
0	the product , quaker instant oatmeal , high fiber , maple and brown sugar , was extremely sweet. way too much sugar taste. i could even taste salt ? i could not taste the oats due to the high sugar content. the product was mixed with 1 / 2 cup boiling water per the instructions. upc 30000 26190.
1	everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this. it is addicting. that includes our 3 year old.
0	i was recently told i needed to reduce salt for health reasons and i was so haapy to get the table tasty and try it. there is a dash of mixture of vegetable taste , however no salt taste. i was very dissappointed.
1	melitta pods are an inexpensive alternative to k-cups that also save in the amount of material you have to throw away. buyer beware : pods vary greatly in the amount of coffee they have in them. these allow for a good size cup of coffee.
1	this food is so full of chunks that my cats just love. they are normally on a variety of top quality pate foods , but i wanted to give them something to chew on and would take them longer than a few minutes to eat. this is stuff kitty dreams must be made of for sure. it is for both of mine anyway.
0	i was expecting a larger granual suger and am dissapointed in this product. i might as well have used normal grocery store ganular sugar ( i.e. , domino ) . not worth returning and i would not buy again. it certainly doesn &apos;t fit my description of &quot; sanding &quot; sugar.
0	being a gluten sensitive individual , i was lured into a false sense of security when i read the simple ingredients on this amazon info page. because i didn &apos;t first do my homework , and read the labels before i began consuming these , i ended up having a massive asthma attack. just wanted to let everyone who has these sensitivities / allergies to avoid this product.
1	i have long searched for a great linguine and spagetti and this is it ! just made linguine with clam sauce and each time my husband remarks how terrific it is. i buy in packages of 5 for both spagetti and linguine and will reorder when close to being out.
0	i ordered three different kinds of yogi tea based on the great reviews -- lemon ginger , stomach ease , and green tea super antioxident. unfortunately , they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. if you like licorice flavor , you &apos;ll like this tea. if you &apos;re looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger , look elsewhere.
1	yo soy corredora , y he probado muchos tipos de productos , este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado.
0	that is so unfair. i was a faithful customer now i have to go buy them somewhere else . why amazon ! ! !
1	these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect. although i wasn &apos;t sure about the peanut butter bar , it was excellent. i loved the roasted almond , roasted pecan and the peanut butter. i will definately buy from this seller again. quick shipping and very fresh.
1	this product works just as advertised ! ! guitar center told me the only way to connect my mic to my computer was either an expensive converter box or a usb mic. a-holes haha. i love this little gizmo and would definitely recommend it to a friend ! !
1	fantastic cocoa. all the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate. i received my keurig as a christmas present and i am loving cocoa at the end of the work day ... no mixing , no microwave and positively no pot on the stove ... just warm , chocolatey goodness on demand. will order this product again
1	i love this water ! i started buying it after my bikram yoga classes to rehydrate , and now drink it whenever i feel a little dehydrated. living in az , i tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too ! try them ! you &apos;ll be hooked : )
1	i recently started using bob &apos;s red mill baking soda. i &apos;m very pleased with it &apos;s performance and i can be sure that it is not contaminated with aluminum. thanks , bob !
1	i have tried all of the flavors and every one of them are all delicious ! they are great for parties and entertaining !
1	love this snack. its really tasty. filling for my wife , not me though ... &quot; i &apos;ll take 2 please &quot; = )
0	while i received my 3 set in a timely fashion , the packaging was horrible. one of my packets was cut and the mix had spilled out on to remainder packets and box. i &apos;m only glad i didn &apos;t purchase the set with the glass in it.
1	very good hot cocoa. and price was right awesome and passing the word on the item. will buy it again
1	these are just like the animal crackers we eat. the price is great and my little guy loves them !
1	this product is very flavorful and you don &apos;t need much of it in your recipe it &apos;s really strong , it &apos;s organic.
0	this is for sure not what i was expecting it to taste like. it &apos;s not bad but not for me. i like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. when i first took a sip of it i noticed it has a bite to it. the best way i can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. i however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.
1	we &apos;ve been searching everywhere locally for this putting. i was so elated to find it on amazon. this is the only pudding my mother made her chocolate pies with and now the tradition continues. thank you so much amazon ! ! !
0	i don &apos;t recommend drinking this tea quickly , or while on medication. i was on antibiotics and a decongestant and was starting to feel better. then , when i drank this tea ( one cup in 30 minutes ) , i felt worse and nauseated. i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s the tea itself , or a reaction with the other things in my body , but i &apos;m going to steer clear of this tea.
1	i am enjoying the recent purchase of popchips , so far i have enjoyed all the flavor choices. the individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if i have a craving for a snack. thanks for the product. jean roth
1	these chips are good , and bad , and create moral dilemmas constantly. if wou are strong at will , or having a large bbq go for it , but as for me , i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days , had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. beware
1	lot of pumpkin seeds in this box of 4 packages. fresh quality product &amp; 24 oz packages made this box a good investment &amp; easy to share with friends &amp; family ! far less expensive than buying these seeds at the grocery store !
1	lets face it , $ 11 isn &apos;t going to get you the most succulent chocolate in the world. but it does give you a great everyday cocoa in a 6oz brew. great to mix with a coffee for an instant mocha , and no sugar needed ! kids will love it. very happy with this purchase. will keep this in my pantry always !
0	i didn &apos;t order because it doesn &apos;t indicate anywhere what size the bottle is , i think that &apos;s basic information , maybe you should include that in your description
1	i shared these with my two older sons , then ordered more. these are great to put in the glove compartment for after work.
1	i thought i &apos;d try the multi-pack to see which flavor i liked the best , but i like them all. they are healthy , fulfilling , and all good ingredients i can actually pronounce. these are the smaller packs , and now i can proceed to ordering the larger bags. love these cookies !
0	this mat is worthless. it is tiny and doesn &apos;t stay put so the cat still gets litter every where. like others said the mat is uncomfortable and the cat just jumps over it. so instead of having litter right in front of the box , she tracks it all over the room. don &apos;t buy !
1	the disposable k cups allow me to use my own coffee with the keurig single cup coffee maker , better than others i have tried.
1	this is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. it is not too sweet , so more for adults than for kids. easy to make. just add milk. no intense mixing required. dissolves easily.
1	my dog loves vitakraft dog drops with carob so much , he &apos;ll do any trick possible to have one ! sadly , they &apos;re getting harder and harder to find , so i was thrilled to find them here - and the price was great !
1	this popcorn is really great ! we enjoy the taste and the smallness of the actual popcorn. its not like the popcorn that is big and fluffy its small and really great to eat. i eat only this popcorn now and order every three months. highly recommend to the popcorn lovers of the world.
0	it is so watery and weak , i had to brew the smallest cup and then put in another pod to get a full cup of hot chocolate. this makes the pods very expensive and not figure friendly. each pod is 60 calories , so a full cup would be 120. will not purchase anymore.
1	this is a quick and convenient way to drink green tea ! i add lemon juice and stevia.
1	i have a larger breed of dog , about 90 lbs and she loves these. at first they seem kind of hard , but she has no problem eating them. they don &apos;t take her very long to finish , but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy. my moms smaller dog , about 12 lbs also likes these , although the smaller ones are best for her.
0	i paid for 100 k cups but received only 98 ! this is the second time this has happened.i didn &apos;t think such about it the first time. now i wonder if this happens often or even all the time.
0	the bag was sealed but it had two cuts exposing beans to air. bottom line is i would not purchase is at a store. when i tried to exchange it , i received a message that the item is nonreturnable. i roasted it on a skillet. it has a delicate flavor and i like the taste.
0	these were not good. they were hard and chewy and my kids wouldn &apos;t eat them. that says a lot b / c my kids will normally eat anything !
1	i have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet ! very nice flavor , doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates. very impressed !
0	this tastes like carbonated orange juice , very tart. it is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages. if one had allergies or health issues , it might be worth drinking.
1	wheat-free , natural ingredients , easy to chew. dry by itself but is good with coconut oil and / or fruit spread.
1	i drink a lot of flavored black teas and this is hands down one of my favorites. the scent is enticing and the flavor is bold , and sweet at the same time. if you love spice , this is a must have tea.
0	it has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. this should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. i would have never bought it had i known. it seems like it would taste good otherwise.
1	the m &amp; m candy machine works just fine but the finger hole is too small for adult fingers to retrieve the candy. it does intimidate a m &amp; m lover because of the small amount it dispenses.
0	i was somewhat disappointed with these apple chips. i have purchased seneca apple chips in the past--i really loved them. i thought these would be similar , but they are rather tasteless , the chips are too big , &amp; they have a mushy consistency. i would not buy them again.
1	i give merrick canned food as a treat and mix it to my dog &apos;s dry kibble ( and the cat even gets a taste ) every now and then. the chicken pot pie smells better than any human chicken pot pie i can remember.
1	love this product ! gluten free products have come a long way. easy to use. great for all your breakfast and baking needs !
1	for the price i think the cocoa cups are very good. i will order them again. they are nice to have in the house for the grand children and the holidays
1	let me preface this by saying i purchased it at a local health food store for about a dollar less. i was pleasantly surprised with this drink. it tastes great , but definitely a little tangy. what i loved about this was how great i felt after drinking it. i felt awake and focused , and just overall really good. i will definitely be buying more.
1	i got it for my girlfriend. very good stuff. now everybody in the house eats them. very hight quality if you are into chocolate and mint.
1	i use this product with my home brewed espresso and milk to make a mocha latte. it &apos;s terrific ! i ordered on the auto ship plan through amazon and save about a $ 1.50 per can over buying it locally. plus i get the added benefit of having it delivered to my door instead of having to drive to a specialty shop to get it ! great product and great service.
1	i have been drinking twining &apos;s tea for years. it used to be made in england but now they have a plant in north carolina for the american trade. the tea is excellent. i drink the decaf for health reasons and find that it is as tasty as the regular tea.
1	we make up a coffee creamer with 1 / 4 part commercial coffee creamer , vanilla , butter creme , almond and bavarian creme flavors and the rest milk. it tastes wonderful and is half the price of store-bought ! it is excellent !
0	my morkie had this ball for exactly 5 minutes and tore the rubber ! i am very disappointed because the concept is exactly what she needs ! !
1	great product , enables you to use your own coffee in your single brew maker. and i can make up several at a time ! ! !
1	i discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal. it was a lot less expensive in the packets then , but i &apos;ve switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. i don &apos;t use sugar and this helps me have the &quot; sweet &quot; and not the increased blood sugar-yeah ! !
0	it didn &apos;t work well for me in the microwave. will not purchase a 2nd time.
1	my dog absolutely loved these , and he would have given them a 10 rating if he could. unfortunately he is nolonger with us , but he thought they were great for years , and this was the best price i ever found. very prompt shipping , and adequate packing
0	the taste and consistency of the nutive hemp shake were great. it &apos;s packed with fiber , protein , and nutrients and with only 80 calories per serving. unfortunately , the shake did not agree with me , and it gave me terrible gastrointestinal distress. i had horrible bloating and foul gas from it , and i had to discontinue drinking it.
1	there is gum acacia in the list of ingredients. not sure if it adds anything to the flavor. the orange and tangerine flavors do come through the fixx. it seems to be a bit sweeter than orange juice. have achieved more satisfying and natural tasting fizzy juice drink by adding sparkling water to oj.
0	i had bought this product last year my dog loved them , but ... i subscribe to a couple of bichon frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from china i threw out what i had left for the outside critters in the forest. i called dogswell today and they verified that even though they say u.s. on them they are still coming from china.
1	perfect year round with just about any meat dish , these omaha steaks twice baked potatoes are a gourmet delight. the consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon , peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor. they cook easily in either the conventional oven , or on the grill when wrapped in foil ! go ahead , treat yourself !
0	$ 59.99 for 6 boxes of 17.7 oz each ( $ 10.00 / item ) , plus $ 14 shipping ? they have them in stores for about $ 5 - $ 6.
1	i could not believe how great this mix tasted ... it &apos;s like eating the regular one. it came out soooooo good , fluffy and delicious ! ! ! ! !
0	i ordered the dark hot cocoa in hopes it would be real chocolatey and it was no better than buying a pouch of hot chocolate and adding it to hot water. i actually think the pouch added to hot water is loads better and a whole lot cheaper ! ! ! ! v-e-r-y ... d-i-a-p-p-o-i-n-t-e-d ! for the price ... it &apos;s a rip-off !
1	i love these chips , i have them on auto order every 2 months , they taste great , i can not belive the whole bag has 100 calories , i have a bag every day , it sure has helped my weight loss by haveing them in little bags , so i do not eat a huge amount
0	i love snackmasters &apos; turkey jerky , so i naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky. this turkey jerky is the same ( or better ) quality as the regular variety , but too dry. i would recomend &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000ezmrra &quot; &gt; snackmasters turkey jerky , teriyaki &lt; / a &gt; , instead
0	the taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. i bought a box of these so i tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. all in all i will stick with the ready to go variety offered by frito lay and mission.
1	i tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best. light but refreshing. i am not sure if i think it is a miracle elixer or anything but i did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis. thank you for the great value and convenience , amazon.
0	this noodle is not made in japan , is from hong kong , the price in supermarket is about 0,45 $ each. please be a honest seller ! ! ! !
1	my 1 year old loves these ! great snack ! i &apos;ve tried to find these at my stores and can &apos;t seem to get them very often. love that they are organic and my one year old loves that elmo is on the box !
1	nice bold taste but with a little &quot; packaged &quot; overtone. like other k-cup products this is just a shade below fresh.
1	pop the can and get sensory caress from the orange scent. the taste is pure citrus bliss. great flavor. i &apos;d say the flavor is halfway between fresh orange juice and really good orange soda. the tangerine is definitely present , but mostly only as a very pleasent after taste. love it.
1	my dogs love the cesar &apos;s softies. get best price from this site. the dog &apos;s are a bit picky about their treats and this one is great ! thanks.
1	i am a big hot cocoa drinker so this hot cocoa i would definitely recommend it has a great cocoa flavor and it &apos;s perfect for those cold fall or winter days. warms you up plus tastes great !
1	i really enjoy this product. i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. once i found it i look no further , it &apos;s the only sugar i use. thanks so much.
1	this is my cat &apos;s third favorite food. it &apos;s great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend. my cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more. they should send me discounts for as much of this stuff i buy. i buy it by the case if that gives you some idea !
0	i just bought my first carton of almond milk , and i have to say i seriously about peuked .. it &apos;s got a very bitter taste , one that i can &apos;t explain ... i wish now i wouldn &apos;t have wasted my money ... i love milk don &apos;t get me wrong , but this is terrible ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! yuck : (
1	not as thick as kettle chips we have had in the past , definitely more like a potato chip and the college crowd loves it. interestingly enough they feel more &apos; gourmet &apos; when eating these. the flavor is not heavily garlic while you can easily taste the cheese.
0	this hot chocolate is pretty blah. not very chocolatey and certainly not very strong. it &apos;s not the fault of the keurig -- the cafe escapes dark chocolate is way better.
1	i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted to try it. i was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated. i &apos;m actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time. don &apos;t trust the fda ! !
1	stocking stuffer gift for family. love this brand &amp; blend. full bodied , not too dark , not too weak. just right. this has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving.
1	ok - this is not the finest european chocolate. but , you can make it in your keurig and all 3 flavors taste good. i &apos;ve joined the &quot; club &quot; and get the lowest possible cost. no charge to join and no effort to quit. why not ? it &apos;s nice to have when you &apos;re dieting , because it &apos;s just enough chocolate to keep you on track. non-dieters will like it for the convenience.
0	these macaroons taste fantastic ; but they are not raw. hail merry is advertising this product as raw and it isn &apos;t. out of six ingredients only two are raw. the coconut oil and sea salt are the only raw ingredients in this product. see back of package for details.
0	product is ok , but i consider it very expensive for a small plastic item ! if i had seen the product in person , i never would have paid that much for it.
0	it is not what i thought it would be. i expected more chocolatey , so i was disappointed. other tassimo coffees are very good , so i won &apos;t let this keep me from ordering others. i especially like the kona blend.
0	my dogs loved this product and i was happy to spend the money on it , but now that it &apos;s made in china- thumbs down , what were they thinking ? i &apos;ll never buy it again. there are better products made in the usa. if you care about the well being of your dog , you will avoid products made in china.
1	as a chocoholic for many years i crave a good cup of hot chocolate. this done in the keurig is really easy and fast. the millk chocolate is tasty and the dark chocolate tastes like the many cups of cocoa i had as a child. not particularly carried away by the peppermint flavor but it was not strong enough to matter.
1	i was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than i expected ginger flavor in this product. it is excellent , if you like ginger , try this. best on hot biscuits ! update. i &apos;ve just reordered , wish they sold it by the gallon , its different , something you can &apos;t find locally and excellent.
1	this is great stuff. made some really tasty banana bread. good quality and lowest price in town.
0	this was my favorite stevia product and i had it on subscribe and save until i queried customer service about nunaturals gmo use. yes , nunaturals uses gmo products. so , i &apos;ve canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001ell3u0 &quot; &gt; stevita stevia clear liquid extract , 3.3-ounce container ( pack of 3 ) &lt; / a &gt; .
0	a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and / or honey. definately not my cup of coffee. oh , did i say it was bitter ?
1	i have been drinking this tea for a long time now. i used to have to purchase it at a doctor &apos;s office because it wasn &apos;t available elsewhere. i &apos;m so glad that i can buy it now from amazon.com. i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee. wonderful taste.
1	i like the variety in this pack-nice to not have to pick out individual jars and my baby likes them all ! the only thing i would suggest is if you have a picky eater , maybe buy one jar at a time to test them out before you buy a huge box.
1	heavily touted by the reviews , decided to try. mix is good , but not great. probably wouldn &apos;t buy again.
1	not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance since it wasn &apos;t that expensive. i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the caviar. i put this stuff on just about anything i could and it was amazing. i don &apos;t know too much about caviar , but for this price i don &apos;t think anybody can complain.
1	really good quality tea. much superior to twinings as tea. the releasable plastic lined paper bag is much superior to the tins to keep excess air out. this is important so the tea won &apos;t oxidize. the tins look nice , but they hold too much air and don &apos;t reseal like a plastic zip seal.
1	i love these crackers ! perfect snack for when i need something salty / crunchy instead of potato chips or other greasy snack. i eat them a lot to hold me over between meals. the price on amazon is great compared to my local markets. highly recommended !
1	you can taste the flaxseed in these whole-wheat muffins and it &apos;s a great taste. good chocolate flavor and texture. i add chopped walnuts.
0	these are not dop they &apos;re just &quot; certified &quot; which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write &quot; department certified &quot; . real dop tomatoes are much better.
1	this is a great and delicious way to eat thia food at home. just &quot; melt &quot; the entire packet ( if you like it spicy ) into two cans of coconut milk in a pan. then add your favorite meat and veggies. i usually use chicken strips and a bag of frozen asian veggies.
1	bought these for a change from the green split peas. they are tasty and i like them. will buy again. always like bob &apos;s red mill products.
1	this taste is between something like flax bread and cornbread ..... excellent toasted with butter and jelly ... did not raise my blood sugar at all .... i love it.
1	i have this on a monthly reoccurring purchase making the per unit price even lower that list. that being said , pop chips are very tasty and the variety pack comes with 6 different flavors. my favorite flavors are salt &amp; vinegar by far. the calorie count makes this snack a very guilt free affair !
0	i ( and my little guy ) have loved almost all other happy baby products , but this was revolting. on the up side , my dog loves it . . .
1	so life with a gluten allergy can sometimes seem unfair ; however , once bisquick started making this product , things got a lot more equal. it tastes like bisquick. it works like bisquick. hey , it is bisquick. it just happens to be gluten-free. perfect pancakes ! enough said.
1	my whole family is addicted to this tea. we make it in our mr. coffee iced tea maker - it &apos;s fabulous !
1	what a nice alternative to an apple pie. love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. easy to prepare. i also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed.
1	it &apos;s a long time since iv &apos;e eaten spam but i decided to give it a try. i always had left overs before but with this size can i simply enjoy every bit in one serving.
0	the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped , very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. i &apos;ve had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time i &apos;ve used the wabash corn. shipping charges were very high for a relatively inexpensive corn.
0	i had ordered this set thinking it was the decaf sweet ginger peach one served at pf changes. i was wrong and instead got over 60 bags of strongly caffeinated tea. the shape is great for a teapot , but awkward for a single cup of tea.
1	we like dark roast coffee because it has more body and tastes stronger. this coffee is just that ! it &apos;s great that it &apos;s both organic and fair trade. the 3-pack means you have coffee for a while , and the price is very good. you can either recycle the can , or repurpose it around the house. all-in-all , a very good deal !
0	this does not taste like cocoa it is very weak no matter what cup size you use.i is just not good.
1	the crust on these tarts are perfect. my husband loves these , but i &apos;m not so crazy about them. they are just too sour / tart for my taste. i &apos;ll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling. my kids think they &apos;re great , so maybe it &apos;s just me.
1	this is great hot chocolate ..... not watery like some others and my husband really likes this one ..... thank you. pat greenough , boise , id.
1	i bought this product because it looked good not knowing if it would taste as good as it looked. well it finally showed up by usps well packaged. it &apos;s soft smells great and tastes even better. you won &apos;t be disappointed. i &apos;ve already eaten five strips.
0	i received the items in a timely manner. upon receipt , i removed a pack to consume. the pop-tart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth.
0	it had a horrable after taste the first time i had it was ok the next it was worst than the first time i had it and the 3rd time i could not eat the sandwich.it has verry bitter taste
1	having tried a very large number of earl grey teas , i &apos;ve been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is. it &apos;s really worth trying. i ended up buying the pack of 6 boxes twice i liked it so much.
1	we are white popcorn enthusiasts , and were very pleased with this product. large , tender kernels of poped corn. used an electric , self stirring poper. worth the cost.
0	this is the first review i have ever done , but i could not let this one go bye. this was the worst ever , save your money.
1	if you like jasmine tea , this is a great tea ! its lite not , overly medicine tasting like jasmine tea can be. its also fun to watch the tea leaves unfurl ... i steep it so many times that until i lost count .. haha. just great .
0	had i known this cocoa was sugar-free , i would not have purchased it. i realize that this will not bother some people , but i really don &apos;t like the aftertaste of fake sugar. in the interest of fairness , this did not seem to trouble my nephew ! just update the description.
1	i feed my two pugs and occasional rescue newman &apos;s advanced dog formula. i like this better than the regular newman &apos;s , because it has less ingredients. i supplement with high quality can food , organic free range chicken , healthy powder and salmon oil. my boys are healthy ; their coats are amazing. highly recommend but with supplements--see above.
1	love this tea , its like drinking liquid red hots. i hate herbal teas b / c they all taste and smell like potpourri but this stuff is awesome ! ! ! !
1	i &apos;ve been using this &quot; low acid &quot; coffee for a few weeks now and along with the taste , i enjoy not having an &quot; acid stomach &quot; , especially the &quot; morning after &quot; . to me , there is no difference in taste between it and regular coffee. i give it 5 stars.
1	these are the best beer sausages i , ve come across in decades ! they taste just like the old time sausages i used to get in bars when i was younger. if you wont take my word for it just ask 3 of my friends ! !
1	&quot; nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites. i was suprised that it was a single box. every time i ordered before it was a 2 pack. my fault for not reading closer. i will not order any more at this price for 1 ( 24 count )
1	not as good as sesmark savory rice minis , but these are available at least. they are very good. more healthy than potato chips and a bigger crunch. mmmmmmmm . . .
0	not much to say , other than the product solicitation is all hype ! i carefully followed the directions on the packaging of the &quot; mberry miracle fruit tablets &quot; and the results were about as miraculous as one of those potato chips baring the face of mary magdelene ! sorry &quot; believers of miracles &quot; ... this is one that won &apos;t make &quot; the tonight show &quot; !
0	these seeds would not sprout. i had to return them since i bought them to sprout. this was a hassle since i had to try to sprout them 2 times to assure it was the seeds and not my mistake.
0	the fda has issued a warning about pet treats made in china. you have to look for the small print on the back of the bag , but these are not made in the usa. please don &apos;t trust the health of your pets to chinese-made treats. i have personally lost a beloved pet. i didn &apos;t know about the fda warning. educate yourself before purchasing these.
1	we have a two and four-year-old and they enjoy these cookies. good tasting very convenient packaging ( individually wrapped ) great for stuffing in glove compartment for emergencies. the right size for our kids no bad stuff no complaints.
0	two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. they all were tiny ! ! ! they are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn &apos;t even fit in the bloom. rip off ! ! ! do not do business with this vendor ...
1	this is my family &apos;s favorite brand of wheat free gluten free cake mix. this brand is moist , tasty and closer to the traditional cake mixes people are used to. namaste products are the best in my opinion of what &apos;s available out there in health food stores. try it ! you won &apos;t be disappointed.
1	i have very little to say about the product except that it is a great product and their delivery subscription works very well.
1	this is very good coffee i have been purchaseing this coffee for a long time an as long as amazon carys tiis i will keep buy it i like the tast it has a nice chocolate tast to it
1	so i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in sf. this was one of those things that i though when im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order. is it worth it ? yes if you are a cheese fan , goes great with any wine ) . not so much if you are being curious.
0	actually i can &apos;t remember a time when i tasted anything so bad. i really could not believe it was meant to be eaten. cannot imagine anyone liking this. it did give me a good example for my daughter why it is important for her to take her health seriously.
1	you can &apos;t beat the price and taste of this coffee. it will always be my first choice to buy. my husband brought it home one day because he liked the price and thought the the can looked neat. little did we know it would become our new favorite.
1	oh man , i , like many of us have tried so many cajun seasoning , but this company does it right ! ! thank you folks at the heart-heat of southern seasoning ! ! all my love , roy watson , 408-464-0100
0	i love hazelnut creamers and syrups so i thought i &apos;d love this one. nope ! i usually buy the starbucks hazelnut syrup. i figured this would be the same , but something about the torani brand hazelnut syrup is funky. i gave all 3 bottles away to family. hopefully they &apos;ll enjoy it more than i did.
1	i &apos;ve been having these cookies for about 4 years , and l love it , but i can not find them , in the store where i used to buy , i live in san diego , so i would like to buy them here , thaks.
1	like always this label is the best in desserts and this 3-4 ounce vanilla pudding is not the exeption , is easy to make , and vey fast , and the size is the best for a little families. the vanilla flavor is fantastic.
1	this is my son &apos;s favorite dinner ! best of all it seems it has the best combo of protein ( 21 % ) , vitamin a ( 100 % ) and c ( 30 % ) . it is runnier than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it. love love love this brand and flavor. i think i purchased 50 jars so far.
1	previously i bought some mustard seed that was unbearably bitter , but the mustard i made with this seed is very tasty and ( after mellowing a few days ) not bitter at all. pleasantly spicy.
0	taste like it is stale. will not order this again. i had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it. this stuff tasted nothing , like the douwe egberts at the hall. this is possibly stale coffee.
1	we love earth &apos;s best. its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. you can also buy a vegetable variety pack , gourmet meals , or my favorite , the seasonal ! good price on amazon too , especially if you do subscribe and save ! !
1	while you would expect ghiradelli to make good chocolate , the flavor of this mocha cocoa is precisely that of great darker chocolate flavor , using just enough coffee flavor to accent the cocoa without overtaking it. a smooth , delicious start or finish to your day - even a warm afternoon pick me up on those chilly days !
0	first off , i love whole wheat products , and flax seed so i hope we just got a bad batch ( and no it wasn &apos;t expired , i checked the date ) but my mom and i just had some of these and we &apos;re not fans. they had an oddly fishy / grassy taste to it kind of like you might get with rancid flax oil tablets. o _ o
1	were just what my wife wanted and she loves them. next she will get the other type of bar by the same vendor.
0	if you like the sour taste almost as if there is a lemon additive in your coffee ... go for it ! not for me.
1	just excellent product ! ! ! ! . i would buy it again. it is better than i was expecting. i do not have any complain about it.
1	this has been my favorite cereal for probably 20 years. the grocery stores stopped selling it , so i &apos;ve started buying it on the web in packs of 5 boxes. i use them up pretty fast.
1	we &apos;ve been trying various rices including aquarello carnaroli and this vialone nano is by far the best. it &apos;s very forgiving of lapses in technique and produced the creamiest risotto of the five brands of rice we &apos;ve tried. be sure to have an airtight container to store the unused rice from each package - the vacuum pack plastic is too stiff to close well.
1	i was really surprised when i tried this product because i found it to be a really light &amp; fluffy batter. so don &apos;t think gluten free means flavorless , this bisquick pancake mix will have you building up stacks of fluffy pancakes for your family. it &apos;s so nice that these are healthier for you , diabetic friendly and still manage to taste great too !
0	purchased the 0.8oz bag ( seemed the same size as the other bags when purchased ) , but didn &apos;t realize it was 0.8 ounces as compared to other bags. just be aware - might be perfect for some , but not for us. having a bag with 10 potato chips in it doesn &apos;t cut it for me. might be perfect for kids - but just a heads up.
1	a grande item ! delicious fish with the ultimate flavor , best ever in a can for all purposes ! i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes , and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties !
1	although i did enjoy the other flavor i ordered a tiny bit more , the chocolate with walnuts one , this was still a very enjoyable flavor. wonderful service from ms. das , including a hand signed coupon for a discount on future orders , along with samples of a couple other caramel flavors. i &apos;d order this or the chocolate and walnut flavor again for sure , along with more of das food &apos;s gourmet salt.
1	we use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say
1	butternut mountain maple syrup is the real deal. the grade b is wonderful on pancakes , or in coffee- just about on anything you &apos;d like sweetened. delivery was timely and the product came as expected. i recommend this !
1	my 10 month old son has been a fan of yummy spoonfuls from his first bite. the garden medley flavor is a new favorite. the puree is thick and almost creamy , perfect for a baby who likes his food to have texture. he &apos;s always happy when i bring a cup of this to his tray !
1	love this flavor ! i make mine with vanilla soy milk and 1 % milk. very nice ! almost like a dessert !
0	i love barry &apos;s gold tea , and everyone i turn on to it becomes hooked. however , this 6-pack turned out to be very stale , with an &quot; enjoy by &quot; date just two months away. this tea had been sitting in a warehouse for about a year , it seems. i &apos;d rather have stale barry &apos;s than no barry &apos;s , but it was a big disappointment.
0	assam is my favorite type of tea , but i was not happy with this particular brand. it is much weaker than other assam teas i &apos;ve tried , and seems to have no flavor no matter how strongly i brew it.
1	this is an excellent tea. one of the best i have ever had. it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.
0	upon receiving the item , i noticed it had a slightly pungent smell. i tasted it plain , and it tasted like rotten tomatoes. it was obviously rancid. i emailed customer service , yet received no reply. i threw the can in the trash. i &apos;m very disappointed in the product , and will buy a different brand in the future.
0	this tea has a smoky undertone to the flavor. all three cans had the same smoky flavor. other than that the tea was fine.
1	once you &apos;ve tried some random sampler packs ( and now are overloaded with decafs , extra bolds , or teas ) , this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want. received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered. this was my second order and i &apos;ll be ordering this item again.
0	i switched to green mountain breakfast blend after not being able to get black tiger as a super saver item. it was a real disappointment. very weak and certainly not something i would want as &quot; breakfast blend &quot; ..
1	outstanding product ... i am always going to have them around. far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition.
1	these are jumbo and flavored nicely , i ended up saving $ .40 per pack as well , good deal. once u go jumbo u never go back.
1	love the fact that it is on subscribeand save. the change to this food has had many benefits. my dog loves it , has aided in the suppression of tear staining ( he &apos;s part beagle , part king charles ) , and makes his poo firm.
0	saw this product online , looked over the reviews seemed favorable. i found this product to be extremely sweet ; its main ingredient is sugar , it states that right on the label. i wish was able to read the ingredients before i purchased this product. i do not recommend this product to anyone who is trying to cut back on sugar in his or her diet.
1	this is a great buy. i love this hot chocolate because it is very low in sugar and has a good taste. it isn &apos;t messy like regular hot chocolate as it is all dissolved before it hits the cup. would buy again.
1	i purchased these little treats as stocking stuffers for our little furry friends. both yorkies loved these treats. we had to finally buy more since they liked them so much.
1	look no futher. always fresh ! nothing is worse than stale candy , , so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today
0	bisquick gf is easy to use. pancakes and muffins are very tasty. the product is quick and easy to use. it makes my day. gram
1	i bought these for my son &apos;s 12th birthday party favor / goodie bag. it &apos;s hard to put together a goodie bag for 12 year old boys , but this is something that everyone likes !
1	since i am counting calories i find wasa crisp &apos;n light very tasty. you can eat three of them and feel like you are eating a lot more than you really are. i think the taste is great and have told all my friends about them.
1	liked the baby food ( yes for myself ; -p ) really tasty and smooth consistency for an organic treat , except the peaches and apricots not soo much nice flavor and such.really good though and timely shipping excellent buyer ! !
1	these are hands-down the absolute best salt &amp; vinegar chips you can buy. they have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted. these are certainly my favorite chips. i highly recommend trying them !
1	old mother hubbard biscuits ( we &apos;ve tried these as well as the puppy variety ) are the only true biscuits my dogs like ! they would eat the whole bag if i let them. the only thing i don &apos;t like is they contain wheat , but as long as your dog doesn &apos;t have a wheat allergy , it &apos;s no big deal. i would definitely recommend them.
1	mrs. may &apos;s pumpkin crunch is the best of the bunch. if you like pumpkin seeds this is for you. the slightly sweet cubes make me think i am eating cake. these are great for snacking and even dessert. a truly wonderful product and gluten-free into the bargain !
1	lucy loves these treats as does her friend , daisy - i do not know what else to say to fill up the 210 word minimum.
0	i eat dried mango almost everyday and have tried so many different brands , but this brand is the worst. i almost thought it was spoiled , but every 1 of the 6 packs tasted the same. mushy and overly sweet. i had to check the package to make sure sugar wasn &apos;t added. i would definitely try a different brand !
0	i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t read the description more closely ... this is just a sugar drink ... argh ! why are people rating it so high ? ? ? why don &apos;t these tea developers use whey instead of sugar ... it has way less useless calories ... oh , now who to give these two cans to without feeling guilty.
0	this device &apos;s lid does not seal. i am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan. did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0012bsmjm &quot; &gt; stash premium green iced tea powder , 12-count packets ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt; easy to mix and refreshing with ice.
0	good but not my favorite ......... newman &apos;s own organics adult dog food formula , 7-pound bag .... i now buy my dogs taste of the wild salmon just great stuff buy it on amazon ! ~ the less fillers the better not meals for my doggies ! ~
0	i &apos;ve tried other nori flakes and loved them. i put them in most things savory for an extra boost of flavor and nutrition. for some reason , my family and i don &apos;t care for the taste or texture of this particular brand of nori flakes.
0	the pork rinds cooked up fairly well in the microwave , but the smell was less than appetizing and the taste was fair at best.
1	my cat tigger eats this stuff up fast. then he asks for more so i figure it must be good. this is not your typical cat food !
1	these lollipops are are well done , look exactly like the picture. not a single one was broken ! they packaged each lollipop so nicely , very impressed !
1	o. n. e. coconut water is delicious and refreshing. it is amazing how it rids me of cramps in my calves and lower back.
1	this fruit gift really was the perfect gift ! everything was fresh , well packed and tasty looking ! and the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. and tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were ! so thank you ! i needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected ! so thank you again ! dharana , san francisco
1	oetker products are always the best. i &apos;ve used them for years because they have unique items that are tasty and easy to prepare. you absolutly cannot go wrong with this creme brulee. why spend a ton of money at a restaurant when you can serve it by candlelight at home ?
1	how can you go wrong with buying these in bulk for less than $ 3 per unit when they can run as high as $ 5 per unit retail ?
1	i have ordered this product twice now and the service and product have been great. would order again ! ! ! price of product was comparable to others. thank you ....
1	i have made this my popcorn of choice. i enjoy the flavor and kernal size.
1	i discovered the kavli thin crackers in paris at &quot; marks &amp; spencer &quot; in 1980 and kavli has been since , &quot; my bread &quot; and i was happy , when we moved to the us in 1987 , to find them also here. i can say that kavli has been an important part of helping me to keep my weight
1	we enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our keurig machine and used to have cafe escapes as our favorite. when i saw the grove square brand at such a great price , i thought i &apos;d give it a try. we love it - it is now our favorite brand. i will be back for more !
1	thank goodness bisquick finally went gluten -free ! i have been 3 years diagnosed with celiac , and besides pillsbury rolls , pancakes have been few and far between as have good biscuits ! we have eaten many pancakes since this product came out. way to go betty crocker ! only negative is that this is actually cheaper in my local stores.
1	i love these little disposakups ! it seems everywhere i go , people have a keurig. at work , my daughters , and my girl friends all have a keurig. except , my favorirte coffee doesn &apos;t come in a premade k-cup so with an espresso grind and these disposakups i can bring my favorite keurig coffee any where i go ! have disposakups , will travel !
0	i bought 4 bags of this stuff and repotted everything in my house. within a week i had gnats all over my house. i have tried everything and cant get rid of them ! terrible , use a different organic product.
1	these chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school. they are by far the tastiest chips i &apos;ve had and it &apos;s impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag !
1	my daughter was diagnosed with celiac about 2 years ago , and has gone without pancakes ever since ... until i happened to come across this at the grocery store. really wasn &apos;t expecting good results - but it &apos;s very good ! the non-celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular ! try it !
0	we love these crackers but getting them through the mail doesn &apos;t work - all the crackers were broken and crumbly.
1	i highly recommend newman &apos;s own organics dog food. natural , high is nutrition and with out fillers. keep your dogs healthy and with lots of energy for a long time !
1	my husband has to limit the amount of sugar he takes in and these contain no sugar , and they taste great !
1	it is cubes for our horses. they came in on time and the horses like them. there is not much more to say about sugar cubes.
1	this dressing became an instant favorite of mine. it &apos;s fat free without losing the flavor. alot of other dresings lose alot of flavor in their fat free versions , and that only makes you have to use twice as much. wish bone is now my only choice for ranch dressing. my husband doesn &apos;t usually go for fat free or diet anything , but i put this on our salads and he didnt even know !
1	fantastic ! you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover
1	the pop chips are really incredible. they are very flavorful and crispy. my favorite is the bbq , but that is just me , they are all good. i would highly recommend these to anyone who is watching their weight of just for overall better health.
1	i had coconut trees growing in my backyard in southeast asia , and enjoyed drinking coconut water right from the coconut itself. taste nirvana real coconut water with pulp is the closest to the real thing that i &apos;ve found.
1	the reason why i ordered this on-line is because the only pop chips they have in my store are the regular and salt and vinegar &amp; barbeque. i love the sour cream and onion ones - actually i love all of them , but it &apos;s great to have them in the 100 calorie bag , because if they weren &apos;t i wouldn &apos;t be able to stop eating them.
1	i love this coffee. i tried it in puerto rico on our honeymoon and am hooked ! i may even go back to puerto rico and get more !
1	as another reviewer mentioned , these treats are crunchy ! . i like them for 2 reasons .. my dog can &apos;t just &quot; woof them down &quot; , she has to chew them , so they last .. and i like that the cruchiness may be good for her teeth. the treats are small , but again , are crunchy ... i &apos;m glad i found these. she loves them and i like giving them to her.
0	this taco seasoning was not good. we used it once and threw the remainder away. i was disappointed since the other seasonings were very good.
1	i got these for my sons 3rd birthday. i got it because i am doing a candy station for his birthday &amp; i wanted to put colorful lollipops as part of the candy station. so this is just perfect for my idea.
1	tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. i definitely recommend faery free. salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of goya adobo.
0	my first can of happybellies oatmeal was cream-colored and odorless , my second can was greenish-brown and smelled rancid ( i immediately threw it out ) , and the third can was also greenish-brown in color but smelled a little less rancid. serious quality issues considering the high price and brand image. i don &apos;t recommend this oatmeal until they acknowledge and resolve this issue.
1	this mix made tasty , crispy waffles using a standard waffle iron , but the whole box only made 3.5 waffles. this would be a five star product for me if i could get more than one family meal out of it for the price.
0	the cheese pack with the popcorn is mostly salt. put it on the popcorn and you have salty popcorn. it &apos;s orange but it doesn &apos;t taste anything like cheese. without the packet it is very bland , dull and only looks like popcorn. best to skip this and look for something better.
1	i have tried a couple different flavors of this soda and found it to be pretty good.its lighter than regular soda.
1	this is the best one. bob &apos;s red mill doesn &apos;t hold a candle to this. it &apos;s fluffy , delicious. and doesn &apos;t stick to the pan. i use 4 : 1 water to rice .... yum
1	eating healthy never tasted so good. tough to find in my local stores but amazon has it at a great price especially through subscribe and save.
1	i love these pop. these are rather small pops about 1 / 2 the size of a tootsie pop. they come in many flavors. i think this bag is great in the long run. 300 just think halloween.
1	this is wonderful stuff , exactly what i was looking for. of all gochujang pastes available , this one is spicy-sweet , with a wonderful depth of flavor. a good addition to soups , stews , sauces and marinades , occasionally i just eat a spoonful straight from the box ! it &apos;s a good topping for noodles and rice bowls , too.
1	i ordered these gummi bears after first trying them at yogurtland. i was a little weary about ordering them because of the last two reviews. but i received a perfectly packaged item. they were not melted and didn &apos;t have a powdery texture to any of the gummi bears. they are my husband &apos;s favorite ! we have been enjoying them since we received them and i &apos;ll be ordering more for events that are coming up.
0	maybe , i got a bad one. it &apos;s very plain , nothing special in flavor. i felt like i wasted my time and money. i will not buy this flavor again.
0	i buy most everything from amazon but not coffee k cups. &#91; ... &#93; has this product and all k cups for $ 13.99 per 24 and free shipping and they ship air ups.
1	i want to give my cats as much variety as possible. they are family and they matter. variety makes them happy. and their health &amp; wellbeing are important. giving them good , healthy food and treats are apart of showing them how loved they are. unfortunately , i have to go online to find some treats as the stores don &apos;t carry the variety any more.
1	this product is excellent. at my local store , they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. it is usually priced at $ 4.99 for 4 bottles , which is expensive as it is. i would try not to spend more than this.
0	as far as canned soups go this is ok. i was disappointed with the texture , extra unexpected bits ( shell pieces ) and overall quality. having been spoiled by living in maine for 20 years before relocating to the south , i tried different brands of canned bisque. i have come to the realization that lobster bisque is best when made fresh.
1	i got tired of overpaying for tea at teavana so decided to try this brand of oolong tea and was pleasantly surprised. it has a wonderful flavor and like the previous reviewer , i just put the bag in a tea ball to compensate for the poor quality of the bags. you just can &apos;t beat the value of this tea !
0	plus they would not accept returns after i opened them ... beware of these. i was expecting something that resembled a chestnut but it tasted like moldy gunk. if there were negative stars , this product would receive negative ... make sure you purchase directly from amazon because the other sellers don &apos;t allow returns. i had to throw the whole case of 24 away.
0	it might just be my preference but i don &apos;t like fruit that isn &apos;t fully dried out like this. it &apos;s very gummy and all taste the same.
0	these taste great ! and it &apos;s true what other reviewers have said about the consistency being good and them not sticking in your teeth. however , as an energy boost for running , they don &apos;t do a thing for me. in fact , they actually cause a stitch. so i just eat them whenever i feel i need a sugary &apos; fix &apos; .
1	i was pleasantly surprised to find this item had been delivered the day after my order , my speediest delivery to date. it probably helps my location is near. everything looks just as described and pictured and i &apos;m very happy to have done business with this seller. the gingerbread house was carefully packaged as not to harm the fragile pieces inside. i &apos;m excited to give this item as a gift.
1	we really like the mccann &apos;s steel cut oats but find we don &apos;t cook it up too often. this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient. anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.
1	these are wonderfully crunchy and delicious. the calorie count is misleading , however ! one piece is more than the 25 calories they claim it is. but it &apos;s worth it ! .
0	don &apos;t the sellers read these reviews and say something to the manufacturer. it is a terrible that amazon can sell this product to the public.
0	this product was a complete disappointment. tastes like mushy pineapple. there was no papaya taste.
0	i bought this product thinking it was a gold sheen as seen on the bottle being sold by amazon. it has no sheen to it at all it doesnt even say sheen , its just &quot; gold &quot;
1	this is a great ham soup base. i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans. great flavor
1	koeze colossal cashews are most delicious cashews i have ever tasted and they are huge. they aren &apos;t kidding when they call them jumbo. they are so very flavorful. order these and you won &apos;t be disappointed ( expect you &apos;ll wish you had ordered a larger size ) .
0	even though the little ones liked this product , i thought it was bland and not much flavor to it. i will not buy more of these.
1	my wife had some white balsamic from a store in boston and loved it. so , i figured i &apos;d get her some for xmas ; but i couldn &apos;t get to boston ! this product and seller gave me a good alternative. it is a fantastic product and she loves it. we use it with lemon or other infused olive oils on salad or what have you. nice !
1	these cashews are the best i &apos;ve ever had and the containers they come in are the perfect size.
0	be cautioned , do not order these in the summer. no protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat , so i received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo ! the entire bag was liquid when i received it.
0	purchased and it came looking new , as i had bought it new , but it was actually damaged. customer service with the actual company is awful--as i needed to contact the company itself to return it.
0	take a cup of salt water add smoke and drink it that how bad it was in my opinion yepper full of salt
0	i have 2 chihuahua &apos;s and they are not at all interested in this toy. i have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less. maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something ?
0	overpriced beans , they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight. the beans were thin and almost dry. get the cheaper options at amazon instead , they are much better and way cheaper ...
0	i selected this company over the other even though the price was higher. i was hoping the pieces would be more consistent in size. it tuened out the container was filled with smaller crum like pieces , worse than the other company &apos;s. i will never buy anything from this company.
1	our corgi loves all sizes , shapes , and flavors of dingo bone treats ! the other reviewer commented on the vendor ; we &apos;ve never got a bad dingo yet ! highly recommended !
1	i love this product ! after ten years of doing without , the pancakes and waffles from this product are fantastic ! i , too , wish it was packaged in a larger box , but as it is , i don &apos;t mind devoting more shelf space to several boxes.
1	these are great. we were told to stay away from wheat , barley and rye. this is a good answer for us. they a not pre-cut so you have to cut them in to. i recommend them.
0	the juniper plant i received died within a month of planting. after i did some research , i found that it does the best outside of the home , which eve &apos;s garden failed to mention in the product instructions. i gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted. i will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again.
1	these things are huge ! i love the way the crystals crunch , and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle. this lemony flavor is my favorite--it &apos;s good on almost everything. you &apos;ll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this.
1	hubby had to switch to gluten free because of gluten intolerance so we tried this and made pancakes. they were great and had sort of a corn bread texture to it. fyi : i made cobbler from an regular bisquick recipe ( not gluten free ) and the measurements do not transfer. the proportions are different with the gluten free mix so make sure you have the right recipe for what you &apos;re making.
1	strong smooth velvety flavor. mahogany describes the color and the mood you get when drinking. absolutely the best. i &apos;ve found my favorite.
0	cracker jacks were horrible--stale , not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired
1	i ordered this salt collection for my husband as a christmas gift. he absolutely loves it and has used it every night since. this is a great gift for anyone who enjoys cooking. i will be ordering the second collection for him soon.
0	these cookies were ok , just ok. i may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies , every last cookies was broken. i understand this is probably due to poor packaging. the consistency was a bit grainy and dry though. and milk did not help. next time i &apos;ll purchase a chewy brand or mrs. fields.
0	this popcorn has alot of hulls i order 4 bags and can &apos;t stand to eat it it &apos;s so hully - terrible
0	ok but too salty. they should make a low sodium version. the spicy is better.
0	what can i say that you probably don &apos;t already know ? it &apos;s monster , a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water. the problem is that i can find this much cheaper in regular stores.
1	wow i heard of this candy but could never find it , now i am hooked. now i don &apos;t have to suck on child lemons with salt , just shakey shakey.
1	this is the best halal beef jerky i have ever tasted. also the company truly gives an orthodox muslim a good choice in buying because when you call them to ask about their slaughtering process they quickly give you the answer unlike other muslim company &apos;s who try do deceive the consumer.
0	don &apos;t waste your money. buy the real cup of coffee and spend the time and money at a coffee shop.
1	if you follow the cooking directions , in my opinion , you have wallpaper paste. cut the cooking time from 30 minutes to 20 minutes , and it is much better - a little chewy , but that &apos;s how i like it ! breakfast takes more planning now , since it &apos;s a longer cooking time than my old brand - but good taste and worth it.
0	coffee tastes great , but the cups get torn apart when brewing. what a mess that is ! ! i am quite disappointed because i do like this flavor of coffee ! !
0	green mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. wife got snookered caused she thought medium roast didn &apos;t have caffeine ; just cause the box was light green. don &apos;t you get fooled too. coffee had a bitter taste had to put more french vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast ) going back to newmans medium roast decafe .. by kuerig.
1	better than expected , but the peppermint flavor lacks a mint smell or taste. this is a good purchase for the price.
1	they are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than au gratin , but nevertheless yum yum yum !
0	my daughter thinks this tastes nasty , and i agree. she is sensitive to carrot , so i was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn &apos;t contain carrot. though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time , she wouldn &apos;t even take a full bite of this. i tasted a little bit , and i can see why.
1	my kids love these and i feel good about giving them to them. they &apos;re all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. we like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. yum.
1	these are delicious. the 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches , definitely more than a serving.
1	i am 76 years old and i have eaten these nuts for many years. the ones mailed to me are very tastey. the only problem is that they were jostled around and a lot of the red skins came off and went to the bottom of the can. no big deal but it would have been better if they had stayed on the nuts. i will order from amazon again.
1	these are good bars for being gluten free. not my favorite bar out of everything they carry but still good to keep around for a hunger attack. if you really want to try something great try their coconut cashew trubar. now , that &apos;s incredible ! it &apos;s like you are being naughty but you &apos;re not !
1	these cloves are very finely ground and extremely pungent. i use them in cooking , i let a small amount soak in coconut oil and use it for massage oil , and also mix it straight into beeswax for candles. it works well on all counts. i am very satisfied and will be reordering when needed.
1	i ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter. she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors. she &apos;s happy , i &apos;m happy ! ! ! &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001eo5qw8 &quot; &gt; mccann &apos;s instant irish oatmeal , variety pack of regular , apples &amp; cinnamon , and maple &amp; brown sugar , 10-count boxes ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt;
0	i ordered a 50 pack of these k-cup and the coffee it self probly good but the seal on everyone of them breaks during brewing and every cup is full of grounds .. ugh and there not returnable ! ! ! ! !
0	i don &apos;t know how they did it - but this is by far the worst tasting carrot juice i have ever had. i think it has to do with the long shelf life - expires in 2012 , i drank it in 2010 ( well i tried to drink it ) . it was probably bottled in 2007 or something. yyeecchh ! !
0	i have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. however this one i received was so weak that neither my sister-in-law or i could drink it. it was left for my mother who likes weak coffee. it feels like it &apos;s only half full so it may have been a bad box. like i said i &apos;ve really enjoyed it the past when i &apos;ve purchased it at the grocery store.
1	we love these crackers for our salmon spread. they have just the right flavor and crispness to enjoy the taste of the spread. and they &apos;re healthy !
0	too salty. but that was not even the worst of the problems. it has a weird texture ( i cooked it perfectly ) and tastes horrible. if you haven &apos;t eaten pork rinds before , please stay away. even the worst popcorn tastes better.
1	i liked the idea theses were from the u.s.a. and loved the taste and quality .. i will buy more .. they are a great source of iron .. and i take them with me everywhere i go for a healthy bit to eat ...
1	i have fallen in love with this tea. i am a british tea fanatic and ashby &apos;s has superceded my tastes and expectations. smooth , not to bitter , low tannins awesome taste ! i &apos;ll take this over pg tips !
0	i purchased the dipsy dog mix with the expectation of a good tasting corndog. whey i fixed my corndog , it tasted like the frozen corndogs you can buy at walmart or any grocery store. taste was not good .....
0	i bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. it tastes like hotdog water.
1	love my taffy she &apos;s so laffy her name is bit o &apos; honey she gives me a kiss oh what , &quot; a bliss &quot;
1	this is pretty good stuff. you can &apos;t expect a whole lot from instant box-o-noodles , but this is the best out of all the other brands i &apos;ve tried before. the noodles have good constancy and the peanut sauce is really tasty as well. i &apos;m going to buy more.
1	i made the pink lemonade cake mix and used this frosting to frost it for mother &apos;s day , and it was a huge success. my mother , who doesn &apos;t normally like cake really enjoyed this. i thought it had just the right blend of tangy and sweet. i hope this flavor sticks around , because it was really good !
1	easy and delicious ! have made it in a 9x5 &quot; loaf pan as well as in a mini-muffin pan ; both methods yield a great-tasting product.
1	i really like the flavor of this hot chocolate. the kids love the flavor too. i always keep a box of this in the house as my kids and their friends are avid coco drinkers. this makes it easier and less messy even for the younger ones. no more powder spilled on the counter tops this way !
0	this is too expensive. buy it in the stores where you can get a single can for $ 2.30.
0	my dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. i have never has one break before. this bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day i gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. it was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.
0	i am an avid consumer of jack links beef steak nuggets. this batch is stale , dry and almost tasteless. i can purchase these in even remote gas stations and they taste juicy and wonderful. i am too lazy to return them but will never buy them over the internet again.
1	the kellogg mueslix cereal was ordered one evening and just a couple of days later it arrived. the item was well packed. contents were fresh. encountered no problems and plan to use this resource again.
1	the hemp oil soft gels really help my sensitive digestion ( along with the probiotic , enzyme and lactose pills ) . of course , i still have to watch what i eat and how fast i eat it ( slowing down really helps bad digestion ) . i suggest buying this product in bulk because the more you take the better it seems to help.
1	the icicle is an excellent product , works as advertised. i think it &apos;s the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computer. the icicle is a fine &quot; plug &amp; play &quot; mic interface.
1	it is so wonderful to eat pop chips. i am a loyal fan and will continue. tasty and healthy. / the flavors are good too and pleasing to everyone with their various choices.
0	when i saw these for the first time online , i thought &quot; sweet deal ! &quot; and i purchased it and when it was delivered , i was so disappointed. the whole thing is about the size of my hand. not going to buy this again and i don &apos;t recommend it at all : (
1	reasonable in price , tastes good. prefect for keurig , which can be pricey. we will probably buy this again. it is mostly for the kiddos anyway !
1	this product is a good addition to fruit smoothies. it thins it out while adding good taste and electrolytes , which are good during the very hot weather.
1	we love this seasoning. easy , fast and great on chicken , fish , pork , etc. just melt a stick of butter and stir in this seasoning until it becomes a loose paste. brush on protein , and sear on a hot pan. cast iron is best. always skin side down. when dark , place in a 400 oven until cooked to correct temp. enjoy !
1	was on gf diet for about 6 months. used this new product from this old quality company with excellent results. still use it for variety. a box goes a long way. a little expensive but worth it.
1	i am not a coffee purist ... but i am addicted. i &apos;ve dabbled in the flavorings &amp; coffee-wannabe &apos;s , and this is by far my favorite. i usually put 1 teaspoonful of instant coffee with three regular spoonfuls of vanilla caramel latte , just so i have an extra afternoon shot of energy. extra bonus - when you pour the hot water over the mixture , it hisses &amp; purrs : )
1	i like my coffee strong. this is the first brand that i have tasted that provides the kick i need without the bitterness. i keep my pantry stocked with mahogony and i do not share !
1	snappy white popcorn is one of the best popcorn i have ever tried. very tasty and most every kernel pops every time.
1	although i like olives , often i only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor. these olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more. i love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time.
1	love , love , love these crunchy little treats. they remind me of &quot; munchos &quot; but without the greasy tounge afterwards. i don &apos;t usually like flavored snacks , but these are all great , not overwhelming and no gross aftertaste. i subscribe to them so i will never run out : )
1	the bbq chips are great. we liked them better than regular chips. they have a nice crunch. hate kettle chips which are so hard that they are like eating shards of glass. we will definitely be buying more of the popchips.
1	these chips are wonderful. my kids and i all loved the salt and pepper. each .8 oz bag was 100 calories , lots of chips for the calorie count.
1	these are hard to find these days. product arrived perfect and the gum was fresh and tasty. we kept the box for about 1 year and the last pack tasted as good as the first.
1	i bought this because my husband wanted to try the french sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show. the grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it. i did not realize , however , that it is not &quot; iodized &quot; and that may be a concern for some folks who need to make sure they take in enough daily iodine.
1	i agree with gary s. it perishable so it need to be ship over night. i ordered 5 pounds and i got it the next day. thanks citymade inc.
1	i found these tubs at costco and was dismayed to discover that they are no longer carrying them. i buy the 4-pack here at amazon and i am very satisfied. the snacks are tasty ; not too salty and offers a variety of chips in the mix that all blend nicely.
0	we didn &apos;t care for this product at all. it seemed to have a funny after taste to it. wasn &apos;t worth the cost. we were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.
0	was disappointed in the quality. the product smelled stale and the taste was not up sun luck quality.
0	vanilla flavor is barely noticeable. acidic taste , not at all what i expected. breakfast in bed and hawaiian hazelnut are much better choices.
0	these came out smaller than i expected , but the taste as not as good as i thought it should be. second time , i added a couple of items , which helped a little , but it is hard to find a great tasting boxed muffin mix. i thought it would save me time , but i like my own muffins better. my husband thought they were okay , but not great.
1	these chips are thick and crunchy. i absolutely love them. the taste is perfect. i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
1	i put all my dogs on this food about a month and a half ago. i began to notice my older / overweight dog become more playful and energetic. he has already lost some weight. also all of the others have more solid stools and they actually enjoy eating this. i would recommend this to everyone.
1	love this ! it &apos;s so good and makes perfect pancakes. love that it &apos;s also dairy free. my husband , who does not have gluten intolerance like i do , likes them as well. hard to tell a difference between this and the gluten-y version. i love companies that make gluten free versions of their foods !
0	the label says &quot; go lean , &quot; but it should say &quot; go diabetic &quot; instead. according to the nutritional information , one cup of cereal has 15g of sugar , which is almost 1 / 4 of the total package ! i had one of these for breakfast and it gave me a headache because of the excessive amount of sugar. this is not cereal , it &apos;s candy disguised as breakfast food.
0	i have another brand of chocolate flavor combined with aspartame that i was hoping to replace with just chocolate flavor. but this takes 3 tablets for one 8 oz cup of coffee , and even then isn &apos;t that good. i wouldn &apos;t buy again.
1	these tasted so good ! i was surprised because i have heard so many negative things about glutten free bread products. i would eat these by choice , not because i have to.
0	third time i &apos;ve bought this brand , , , it is stale , , not gonna bother to return it , , , no second chances , will find another brand. i &apos;m sure another brand offers the same size. to be clear , the first boxes were fresh. take your best shot.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000gevgxa &quot; &gt; goccia black truffle oil from italy &lt; / a &gt; i highly recommend this product , for the price , the qaulity is exceptional. it brings on a strong &apos; sense of euphoria&apos;
0	i received the pant faster than expected , but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised. i have very little hope that this plant will live out this week , but if it does i will update this review with a higher rating.
0	nice price , and glad to see a subscribe &amp; save option on k-cups. however this was undrinkable in our opinion. didn &apos;t seem to be too watery like another reviewer said , just a bad off taste.
0	part of me wants to ask for a refund. i bought this package of k cups because i wanted a mix of teas. when i got my package i was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. i know they substituted based on availability but i think it &apos;s completely misleading to substitutes with products that don &apos;t pertain to the packaged theme. i got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. disappointing !
1	i just got these , they are moist and gooey and fresh. i actually got more beans than the approximate ammount. they came faster than expected. great transaction !
0	this tea was supposed to be loose tea. i purchase loose tea all the time. instead of packaging the tea in bags , they left it loose. gave a very couldy tea with a bitter taste.
1	my wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great. she says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter. i don &apos;t drink coffee but i took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
0	these are only half the size of the pixy stix i ordered 6 mos ago. 1 / 2 ounce each. that translates into a heck of a price increase.
0	my 10-month old hates this ! even when i mix it with the earth &apos;s best veggies that he loves , he will spit it out. tried the salmon and the ratatouille and he hates all of it. bought three cases of the stuff ! ! ! now what to do ? will keep on trying it.
1	hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores don &apos;t carry it , as we live in a very small town. the flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful. i start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee. i will buy again and highly recommend. arived far earlier than i anticipated.
1	our acupuncturist recommended this to us , to lower my cholesterol and to lower my husband &apos;s blood pressure. so far so good. we have been taking it for a little over a month , so in a few more months , we &apos;ll have a better idea of its effectiveness. we take two capsules in the morning and two at night
0	the flavor is not very good- tastes very artificial. also i seemed to get a stomache ache after using the product , and i see in the reviews that i &apos;m not the only one. its only redeeming quality is that the texture was fairly good , in that it dissolved well into soymilk. otherwise it would have only been one star.
1	my son has been eating these for the last two years and loves them. i love them because they have yogurt in them , and for a picky eater provides some good nutrition. wish they were organic , but we can &apos;t have them all. much healthier than nutragrain.
1	i &apos;ve had the other nana &apos;s no gluten cookie bars in berry vanilla , and they aren &apos;t that good. but , the chocolate munch flavor is good. they are more moist , have a good flavor and a little crunch. the only reason i &apos;m giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. i will be buying these again.
0	just tried a bowl again after many years and shared it with a friend who has never had the &quot; pleasure &quot; of the chef &apos;s creations. this stuff was nasty when i was a kid and it has not changed .... it &apos;s still nasty. an insult to italian-american cuisine in general and ravioli in particular.
0	these had heat and had good enough coating of the seasoning. the first 2 cases were amazing best i had ever. then they restocked and tried 4-5 cases and they taste either like plain chips or slight hint of seasoning on them. what a shame they seemed to cut back on quality to save money. bad uncle ray !
1	arrived slightly thawed. my parents wouldn &apos;t accept it. however , the company was very helpful and issued a full refund.
1	i enjoyed this product. they are a good value for the amount you get. i did not sense much honey in the product , so a bit more flavor would be nice. i would buy again.
1	it tastes pretty decent but i wasn &apos;t aware how pricy they were when i bought them. i paid $ 17.44 for a pack of 12 ! ! ! what a rip off !
1	use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week. love this product. fast shipping , as usual. would buy again.
1	we love these. can &apos;t always get them in local stores , they don &apos;t keep them stocked even though we are always buying them out. strong enough to dip in any condiment , great flavor and grain texture.
0	terrible ! artificial lemon taste , like pledge lemon furniture polish. don &apos;t do this to yourself. just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest.
1	i have never been addicted to anything in my life ... until i tasted these chips. i have tried other brands of the sea salt and vinegar flavor and they are just not the same. you &apos;ve got to stick with this blue bag of chips !
1	these are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best ! sad to see on amazon they are no longer available ; - ( quick shipping and they arrived safely !
0	i wanted a new challenge for my terrier , and she figured this out in no time flat. then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits. so , the product is not challenging and not robust. maybe this would work for a declawed cat , but if your dog is halfway on the ball , get something else.
1	my daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this. we tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn &apos;t like the texture of them. this is really good for her and she likes it , so we keep buying it.
1	these are the best gummie bears i have evvvveeerr had. we sell them where i work so i had to get my hands on some. the flavors are so vibrant and just pop in your mouth
1	i bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. he loves these , and apparently his staff likes them also. there are generous amounts of twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag , and this was well worth the price. &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b001gvisjm &quot; &gt; twizzlers , strawberry , 16-ounce bags ( pack of 6 ) &lt; / a &gt;
1	i love cofee. yuban is one of the better ones. maxwell house is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent. yuban is rich , robust , and stronger than most other coffees i have tried yet not bitter. overall , i highy recommend it.
1	my daughter who is type 1 diabetic and has celiac loves these cookies. have had a hard time finding them in the local health food stores so was so happy to discover them on amazon so bought 2 cases of them so now there is enough for the whole family.
0	the freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place , these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting ... i have several bags you can have for free.
1	i haven &apos;t been able to drink coffee for over 5 years due to gastritis and indigestion with even a few drops of the stuff. coffee is my favorite and reaching desperation i gave puroast a try. this stuff is a miracle- not only am i symptom-free , it is good coffee. i am so thankful to be able to have coffee back in my life !
0	sadly i got really excited when i saw this and the toy these go into that i bought a few flavors and the toy asap. she isnt into them = &#91; hopefully she comes around and starts to use it but we will see. if she does i will make an update !
1	these bites are &apos; just enough &apos; for a snack. they are delicious and the price is very reasonable ! i will definitely purchase from this company again.
0	my little dog wouldn &apos;t even lick it , she isn &apos;t going to even get close to it. beware ! she loves her treats and i was hoping after reading the other reviews that it would be good for her and her breath , but what a waste of $ 5. so frustrated ! just a friendly warning , you might have to send them back.
1	we love this crisp bread because it &apos;s made from 7 whole grains , does not contain any corn syrup and stays fresh for weeks after being opened. it &apos;s soft yet crunchy and tastes great. can only recommend and will definetly buy again.
1	i have been eating the 100 calorie chip ahoy for sometime. i really find that it is a filling , guilt-free snack. it has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet &apos; food-type taste either , it taste like a `real &apos; snack.
1	&quot; it tastes better than it looks &quot; was the first thing i said the a skeptical co-worker looking at my peanut satay as it came out of the microwave. unfortunately , it &apos;s as fattening as it looks , so i likely won &apos;t be purchasing it often. i could see this mixing with chicken or beef and tasting even better though !
0	i &apos;ve been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate , and it isn &apos;t great. it &apos;s not badly priced , and the first few sips are fine. but after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates. it ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom.
1	i love this sauce. sweet but hot too. i use it on checken wings instead of buffalo sauce and with pan seared scallops , shrimp. it &apos;s very versitile and delicious !
1	this is a great chip replacement ! wow all the flavors are terrific , good with a sandwich , soup , or just a late night snack !
0	this one baffled me. my blue heeler loves &quot; figure it out &quot; kind of toys , but she was not interested in this at all , not even for 2 minutes. i put her favorite treats it , spent days trying to intrigue her , but to no avail. maybe it &apos;ll work for somebody else. pay my shipping and i &apos;ll send you mine for free !
1	i highly recommend this product. can &apos;t beat the calorie count. my favorite use is putting natural crunchy peanut butter and blackberry jam between two pieces. also great with cheese. healthy product.
1	i eat a bag of these every single day ! they are the best tasting good for you snack ! everyone should at least try them and you will be hooked.
1	if you &apos;re looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals , this is a great option. the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters.
0	we love trader joe &apos;s just the clusters vanilla almond granola cereal but were very disappointed with the quantity we recived for the price charged. as a result , we returned same.
0	i tried these and wanted to like them , but just couldn &apos;t. they did not seem to &quot; pop &quot; very well ( a lot of wasted product in the bag ) and they didn &apos;t taste very good. i will not be buying these again.
0	amazon sends you twelve boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears fast - in fact , do not sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping ! they are delicately sweet , crunchy , and buttery - without being at all greasy. you &apos;ve been warned !
0	i order a lot of bars from amazon , these were not a favorite. not bad , but there are better bars.
0	we loved this product until shipments starting arriving in june--in texas. the taste is terrible ! no ginger taste left , not happy with the product at all any more. sad ... loved it back in the winter and spring. guess it can &apos;t survive the heat in travel.
1	my son can not get enough of these fruit purees. i can not think of a higher standard of praise for this product !
1	my father grew up in argentina and since he came to the states has been searching for the perfect dulce de leche that reminded him of his childhood. he doesn &apos;t have to search anymore , i bought him a couple of jars this past christmas and he has been a happy camper ever since.
0	been gluten free for 7 years now. thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful. we threw it away because we did not like it. for my money , you can &apos;t beat pamela &apos;s baking mix. but , the betty crocker chocolate chips are the best ! so , don &apos;t give up betty crocker , just work on this one !
0	i bought this at a local albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised. there is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product. even the salt flavor is off. avoid this product.
1	twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand. if you can get these for $ 2 to $ 2.50 a package with free s / h it &apos;s a good deal. the black and cherry have good taste ; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
1	all three tastes rich and chocolaty , not chalky at all. we were surprised how good they are , better than any other k-cup cocoa we &apos;ve tried.
1	my son has severe allergies. this is an item he loves and is a convenience for me. i feel good giving them to him and they taste great !
0	... but that is about all. it appears a lot of taste was sacrificed to achieve the low acid. i think the reason it is french roast was to try and add some flavor. i would rather do without coffee than to drink this. not recommended.
1	this stevia is the best tasting we &apos;ve ever tried. it also mixes into beverages more thoroughly than some others.the service from this buyer was prompt , the product arrived on time and in excellent condition. would order from them again , and recommend them to others.linda blyth
1	i use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price. frontier met that discription.
0	the item was delivered here in great condition. my 5 month old american eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. but after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. my puppy didn &apos;t even play roughly with it. it could have been dangerous if he ate it. luckily i was there.
0	i admit , i am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. but , this one is not for us. we both love the rodeo drive. i have a good freind that loves this coffee. i sent her ours.
1	i &apos;d rank toffifay as tied with ferrero rocher for the greatest chocolate candy ever. sadly toffifay is impossible to find depending on where you live. i thought ordering 24 packs would be overkill but i &apos;m going through these things like nobody &apos;s business. at this rate i &apos;ll have to tack on an extra mile onto my daily running regimen
1	another great hit from coffee masters ! this one has a rich , dark chocolate flavor that &apos;s not too intense but just right. the coffee is foll-bodied and very smooth. i will definitely order more from amazon.
0	i was optimistic about this , but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal. we threw out all 6 boxes.
0	i have ordered this blend several times &amp; liked it. this shipment was bitter. maybe it was just a bad batch or maybe old.
0	when i cannot get libby &apos;s , i am very happy to get this. i don &apos;t restrict myself to organic. it is watery , however. which requires either straining or altering recipe. this review is for organic caned pumpkin.
0	i have to agree with the other reviewer that the package does not seem consistent with the contents. i &apos;m not taking any chances on plastic in the microwave. i &apos;ll stick with earth &apos;s best.
1	delicious and unique flavor , great for those who like a little tart taste. nice the have a 12 pack since they are pretty hard to find.
0	these truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. i thought for the price they would have a greater taste , but they didn &apos;t have much taste at all. they are not worth the price , but had to find out for myself. i will not be buying truffles again , and i &apos;m not going to spend over $ 10 for a fresh one.
0	was really dissappointed in product ... too salty and poor flavor .... convenience is what makes product worth purchasing if you like pork rinds ...
0	the flavors of these are a bit on the strong side. wish i hadn &apos;t bought so many ... i thought i would love them since parmesan and garlic are two of my favorite flavors. oh well ...
1	i love these. they really taste like a soft pb &amp; j sandwich , and you can bring them anywhere ! kids would love them too. i hope they &apos;re available again soon because i &apos;m running low !
1	love this pasta. does cook up a little firm , cooked it a bit longer. had it with pesto very good. my husband could not tell the difference so i know it is good. he is very fussy.
0	just had this to make a pb &amp; j and i was really just eating a jelly sandwich. i guess it would be ok to mix into a smoothie ( maybe ) , but i didn &apos;t think it had any flavor at all.
0	disappointed. the big boxes had a very different flavor than the smaller boxes. i am not sure why but not good.
1	i use this stuff on pretty much everything. turkey sandwiches , homemade sushi , scrambled eggs , chicken nuggets , and more. so perfect. not too spicy , not too sour. not too expensive either. love it.
1	just what i was looking for tired of going to the store to pick these up and always being sold out ! i love the flavor not so sweet and just right ! ! thank you ! and will be buying again ! !
1	first , yuban is my favorite coffee. to be able to buy a case and save is great. the coffee was in date , the seals on the cans were excellent , and the freshness of the coffee was excellent. i will definitely buy more yuban coffee when i need it from amazon groceries.
1	i have used this product for a few years now. this being the first time from amazon. i &apos;m glad it was there. this is by far the best pancake / waffle mix on the market bar none !
0	when the flowers showed up , they were in pretty bad shape. i figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days. didn &apos;t happen. they went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival.
0	i don &apos;t know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime , but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough.
1	this product is my wife &apos;s favorite. kids love it too. would suggest it if you like cinnamon. i would buy this again
1	i like the slight pineapple flavor in this better than the plain coconut water. good well chilled. coconut water is supposed to be a healthy drink.
1	4-year old elkhound loves this food , and it keeps her in great health. amazon has the best price i &apos;ve found for this food , and it &apos;s even better with subscribe and save. i highly recommend it.
1	this was a great buy for the money and a hard product to find. i was pleased when i received it doing it this way i cut my coffee costs down by 2 / 3rd even after you consider the price of the product i am very happy
1	shipping was quite a bit but the bottles were all unbroken and in good shape. since dublin no longer makes d.p. i wanted some bottles for a keep sake. these meet the bill. over all good experience.
0	i will never again even consider a dog food with corn , wheat or soy in it. grain has no place in a dog &apos;s diet !
1	these chips are delicious and low in calories. i love the salt and vinegar , and the barbeque. we buy them by the case. they are great. thanks for offering them.
0	bought these jack link &apos;s beef sticks a second time because i was so pleased the first time i purchased them. this time the quality had gone down significantly , they were much greasier tasting and less flavorful. then , they began to get moldy ... within two weeks of receipt ! needless to say , i was not happy with this purchase.
1	my fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don &apos;t carry them anymore ! once again , amazon came through and he couldn &apos;t be happier.
0	i just received this and i expected this to be decaf regular unflavored coffee. this actually is a variety pack. it has multiple flavors and i am not a fan of the non-decaf version of these flavors. i will be returning ...
1	these chips are incredible ! enough can &apos;t be said about them. they are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories !
0	no thanks. kind of bitter and has slight overtone of cardboard. organic bold and donut shop are still our faves.
1	i received the box of chocolate and was very pleased . the box was in excellent shape and was wrapped well. the candies were fresh and delicious. would get again.
1	when i opened the package , i expect the same old tasting beef jerky but my taste buds surprised me. this beef jerky tastes amazing ! i &apos;ve been buying products from amazon.com for years was really inspired to leave any feedback but as soon as i tasted this beef jerky , i wanted everyone to know. i just ordered 5 more : ) - baba ali
0	i bought this brand because i heard good things about it and i was comfortable with the ingredients that were list. when i tried to feed it to my dog he would not touch it and usually he is not a picky eater. this is not a negative review in any way against the product itself but just an fyi to other pet owners.
0	ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid. read the ingredients. the main label says olive juice by no such thing. i am going to suggest that amazon take this off the website.
0	this tiny box of mediocre chocolates cost 20 $ ... not including shipping. not worth it. just go with sees or godiva .... i wish i could return it
0	the coffee itself tastes ok , but is weak and doesn &apos;t pack the punch i &apos;d expect from &quot; extra bold &quot;
1	not being a hard core gum chewer , i was thrilled with this gum. a great taste in a gum that last plenty long without any loss of flavor or any kind of after taste. a pleasure in my diet routine.
1	my synagogue &apos;s passover care package had some of these candies in it , and wow are they good ! americans have little exposure to sesame seeds except atop a burger bun. time to taste these nutty little wonders ! individually wrapped to keep them fresh and slow you down ( grins ) . better than peanut brittle any day ! and these are kosher for passover !
0	caribbean joy coconut milk offers a tempting price , lower than its competitors. there &apos;s a good reason for its low price : by all accounts it tastes like half the visible amount is coconut milk , the rest being water. neither good for pina coladas or cooking , this is a poor value and i can &apos;t recommend it to anyone.
1	they are awesome to snack on. they have a little kick to them but that &apos;s the best part. they help me with my cravings for sweets.
0	my dog has still not figured out what to do with this. he is a very smart dog with a vocab of about 50 words. i was surprised how hard the plastic is and am also worried. once he does figure out how it works i am afraid he will knock himself out when he shakes it from side to side ! let alone what will happen if it flies out of his mouth !
0	they didn &apos;t honor price listed and when i called and sent several emails to complain they stated it was a computer &quot; glitch &quot; and proceeded to refund my money. a week before valentines day. i was sending over six orders and they royally screwed me and did not have enough customer service experience to honor the price it sold for. i will never order from this company ever again !
0	this tea was a major disappointment. i had been used to drinking the assam from teaism in dc and was looking forward to buying this variety of assam in bulk to save money but it ended up being a waste of money. there is no flavor no matter how long you steep it or how much you use. it gets two stars because it does not taste bad , there just is no taste.
1	i only use raw sugar , it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good. will buy again.
1	these muffins were very good made according to the recipe on the box , but when i changed the recipe a little , by substituting almond milk for the 2 % milk , and extra virgin olive oil for the butter , they were great ! next time , i am going to try adding some grated carrots and not adding the sugar. thank you hodgson mill for a wonderful gluten free product.
1	great basic hydration for summer. satisfied with the amount of sweetness. i mix with water and ice cubes for instant satisfaction.
1	i have to disagree with the other review here ! i love the little bits of crunch in these otherwise really soft cookies. i love the banana taste , and i love these cookies ! it &apos;s so nice to have a a gluten free cookie option that doesn &apos;t suck ! i totally recommend these !
1	best flavor ever ! i &apos;m addicted ! they are all good but these are by far the best. i could live on these ! and there is no need for anymore to say ....
1	these beef sticks have a great flavor and the price seems fair. there is no label stating as to where this product needs to be refrigerated.
1	i cant keep enough of this in my house. my kids drink it like its going out of style. i love it cause its so easy to make just water and the packet the best part is that is sugar free.
1	this particular type of yuban coffee is a mild , flavorful coffee that can be enjoyed in the morning or anytime. it &apos;s the coffee my mother seems to prefer over all others. not always available in stores , i was thrilled when i found it for sale by amazon !
0	i purchased the baby white by accident. we usually get the medium white , which is great. the baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it.
1	deal was awesome ! arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters. i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store &apos;s candy.
0	this has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed. definitely not a natural made from scratch taste. it made the worst tasting margaritas that i &apos;ve ever had. my initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses. i &apos;m glad i only bought one bottle to try.
0	avoderm has always been near the top of quality dog foods , but what a smell that came out of that bag of dog food ... had to throw it away .. do not buy until seller chimes in that they have a new batch
1	had been feeding my 3 hounds purina one ( which they liked ) and thought i &apos;d try this since it &apos;s not much more and i liked the ingredients. they love it and i plan to order more in the future !
1	good thirst quencher. milky and thicker then i expected. not what i would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.
1	i purchased this mix to use with my new presto flipside belgian waffle maker and am very pleased with the results. it took 3 cups of this mix to make 6 large belgian waffles and they cooked to perfection after only 4 minutes ! the flavor of this mix is slightly sweet but there is no aftertaste to it like you get with cheap commercial brands like bisquick. i &apos;ll be buying more , for sure !
1	i bought these for my grandbabies because they are earths best and organic. they like them , but not as well as the cinnamon ones. i tried them , thought they tasted kind of like dirt.
1	i like it and i find the grinder bottle to be very convenient. i like the taste of it and i would definitely buy it again , and considering its healthy use for sure.
1	my dogs love it , even the little princess terrier. i &apos;ve tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far.
0	a german shepherd breeder recommended this food for my itchy gsd. no way .. he hates this food. it smells like cat food actually. i have a case and a half left .. guess i &apos;ll donate it to the shelter. shame as it is expensive .. they won &apos;t eat the dry kibble in the trout formula either.
1	i didn &apos;t read the reviews thoroughly and found out too late that this product has enough sugar to give it 60 calories and 11 grams of carbohydrate in each cup. i tried one with a bit of cream and found it to be very tasty. i &apos;ll keep it around for friends and family or perhaps an occasional mini-splurge. i &apos;d like to see amazon include nutritional info in the future.
0	this flavor is awful ! we absolutely love all the other flavors but goji cacao &amp; maca is really difficult to get down. i give all the other flavors 5 stars !
0	the product that i received was not the product that was pictured and described on the item &apos;s page. the worst part of it all was that when i attempted to return the case of &quot; soy crisps &quot; , i was unable to do so. amazon said that this was a non-refundable item. so i wasted $ 30.00 and i am stuck with a case of &quot; soy crisps &quot; that i will not eat.
0	if i could give this product a minus 10 stars , i would. there is now very strong evidence that chlothianidin which is in this product is one of the pesticides that is affecting honeybees and contributing to colony collapse disorder. this us has yet to ban this pesticide , but it has already been banned in other countries. avoid this product and any others containing clothianidin.
0	i &apos;m sorry but this tastes bad. you get watery rice ( yes i drained it according to instructions , but it still tasted watery ) , bad flavored sauce , very little chicken. it &apos;s a good idea , but it needs work.
0	the &quot; white chocolate &quot; coating is so thin i can literally see through it. the inside of the bar is brown and terrible tasting. this is absolutely awful. do not buy.
1	the best treats available. your dogs will go bonkers for these. i buy a tub a month for my little munchkins and they just love it. good value online.
1	i love the pineapple the best. had a hard time finding this at the store , they get ya hooked and then stop carring it.i have tried the other brands of coconut water but i &apos;m just not loving them , so i went online hoping to find this brand and there it was.now mom &apos;s happy and so is everyone else ! love the vita coco !
0	this product is definitely not as good as some other gluten free cookies ! try pamela &apos;s !
0	we recently purchased the k-cup machine and i was quite excited as i drink iced tea rather than coffee. this blend of black tea is quite bitter and not at all what i was looking for. it works as advertised , just not the right tea for me.
0	this stuff is crap. it kills flowers , there leaves &amp; curdles after a week. waste of time &amp; money
1	i love this. i have celiac , so this was the first time i had pancakes. i loved them , so did the rest of the family ( they can eat wheat ) .
0	bought the teriyaki flavor ..... totally gross , do not waste your money on this slimy stuff .... could barely finish my first bite .... i gave it one star because amazon doesn &apos;t allow 0 star ratings ...
0	under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the usa. i got the lamb and rice jerky today and it says on the package the lamb comes from new zealand. that &apos;s a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. very disappointed.
1	i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking , i love the regular , i use it on everything. you won &apos;t be sorry you tired it , great for dipping bread and cooking omelet , and green beans.
1	this little packet makes a whole pan full of sweet corn goodness. is it a side dish or a dessert or both ? you decide. easy to prepare and delicious on the table.
1	the kids like cocoa. perfect when you can &apos;t make the kids hot choco. tastes good too. 24 count ? not bad ...
0	i don &apos;t care for the unpleasant aftertaste this leaves. i loved that it was organic , and wanted to try a new sweetener. it dissolves easily in my hot tea , but it gives that coconut flavor and tastes slightly metalic.
1	we love this coffee. it is the best k cup we &apos;ve found. we like strong coffee and struggled at first to find one that we enjoyed. the prices on amazon can &apos;t be beat and the shipping super fast.
0	i have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days. within 5 minutes of eating them , they are both throwing up. i will be going back to the three dog bakery treats. expensive but have never made my cats sick. why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews ?
0	this is suppose to be a &quot; healthy &quot; snack. then they shouldn &apos;t sneak artificial sweeteners in. i do like the taste , but i &apos;m going to have to go with another flavor. i got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn &apos;t have sucralose. so just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients.
0	you can get these sooooooooooooo much cheaper at wholesale clubs. i get the 24 / 20oz ( yes 20oz ! ) for $ 11 or $ 12 ! ! its actually even cheaper then buying the bottles from the regular store !
1	a suprisingly delightful snack ! great to have around while i &apos;m working long hours in front of the computer.
0	becareful if you plan to use these more then two months after you order them , they expire quick. i can &apos;t use these , i ordered them to use in my november wedding but they expire in march : (
1	different flavors for different people. not everyone is going to like this just as others , like me , will love this coffee. it &apos;s totally subjective. i give it 5 stars. i enjoy this coffee a lot and the price is very reasonable , in my opinion. it matches my local big box grocery store.
1	my 8 month old loves these. he hardly swallows one bite before he &apos;s already opened his mouth for the next bite. i make my own baby food when i have time , but when i don &apos;t , this is a great alternative.
0	i would never ever ever buy this gum again. not sure what extra was trying to accomplish here but i &apos;d advise you to buy a pack in store before purchasing it in bulk. i am a gum lover ! i wouldn &apos;t chew this if it were free. it tastes chemically , no identifiable flavor , just ick.
1	i just love this. even on my diet i can have hot &amp; yummy oameal ... it is satisfing &amp; without that rich brown sugar flavor its just not the same taste ... love it ! ! !
0	i can &apos;t get my 10 month old to eat any &quot; dinner &quot; type baby food. i thought this would be different , but it &apos;s not. baby doesn &apos;t like it , so it &apos;s no good to me. not sure what i am going to do with the other 15 packs.
1	this sauce is excellent for authentic chinese dishes ! my wife is from china and we love to use this product to make hot pot and ma po tofu.
0	i have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. it has such a bad aftertaste that i checked the box to see if i ordered sugarfree by mistake ! i will toss this and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this , dont buy this brand. its downright awful !
1	the products are wonderful and fresh ! ! everything reported about the chips is on target , and i would recommend them to others. amazon &apos;s services are fantastic ! !
1	just the right amount of blueberry flavor , and the tea itself is not overwhelming. i love that it has no added sweeteners , and really does not need them. this is a perfect way to get more water and benefit from the antioxidants in the tea as well !
1	i see a lot of complaints about grove square hot chocolate. i think it tastes ok considering it &apos;s a k-cup , not homemade and not gourmet. i don &apos;t have anything negative to say the company or the product , it &apos;s relatively inexpensive and the company didn &apos;t falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste.
1	i wanted to grow some cat grass for my kitty to distract him from my other plants in the house. i planted them in a large window sill box with potting soil. i had a large bunch of grass in about a week. my cat loves it and it looks great in my kitchen.
1	i am addicted to this candy. will try not to order another batch for awhile ! ! ! this is my candy to eat on the ride home from work in traffic to keep me calm.
1	my mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate. add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing.
1	i really enjoy this hot chocolate with a little fat free half &amp; half for creaminess. being that i am not a coffee drinker these k cups offer a nice change from tea. the local stores sell this as well but it &apos;s half the amount of cups and almost the same price. buy from amazon.
0	as posted in the &quot; black cherry &quot; review , 33 grams of sugar is way too much for me but may be great for others who can handle high sugar content. the kiwi is a refreshing taste but i could only drink a small amount because of the sugar. cute little can - much smaller than the typical soda size.
1	this is a terrific baby food. it has beef and spinach and tastes great ! it was the first meat baby food my son would eat. i tasted it myself and it &apos;s quite good.
1	these are unbelievably fantastic ! i had to share them , i had so many ! simply the best ! i put the leftover pods in my sugar , smells amazing !
0	wolfgang puck recently changed their chicken soup. the old stuff is excellent. the new stuff is watered down , not filling and doesn &apos;t taste as good. the image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. the soup i received is the new stuff. being a food item , returns are not allowed. i feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased.
1	my little ones love seaweed and rice and this seaweed did not disappoint. other brands are too oily or salty or not enough. this one though is just right. i would be buying it again ... and again.
0	all of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. truth is , i am disappointed. the popcorn kernels are tough , chewy and lack any great corn taste. i want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it. i will go back to buying the premium orville redenbacher &apos;s brand at my local grocery.
1	this is the best popcorn i have ever ate. i use a whirley popper to pop my popcorn. when you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. i gave my orville redenbacher &apos;s and walmart popcorn away .. to many husks. you just can &apos;t beat this popcorn. it tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.
0	not that good , and it does have a very very strong taste. i think this would be my last resort coffee. it tastes like a cheap dark chocolate raspberry candy.
0	the artificial sweetener ruined this for me ... it leaves the fake sugar taste in your mouth and my husband , who drinks diet soda , even noticed. at least it wasn &apos;t pricey.
0	i couldn &apos;t get past the acidic taste of this coffee. i know french roasts are strong , but this one was overpowering.
0	sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible. use caution before buying this item since there are no returns and you might find yourself with a throw away.
1	seems stange that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock iun the stores. so glad to find it on amazon ... and at the rate we eat this - especially in the winter with chili , won &apos;t have any problem going thru the bulk order of 12 pkgs ... thank you amazon and chi-chi &apos;s !
0	the flavor of big train hazelnut is not significant. one has to add a lot to have a flavor impact. of the three big train flavors i purchased ( including vanilla and irish creme ) , hazelnut is the least satisfactory. ( vanilla &apos;s a little better ; irish creme is best--i gave that one 4 stars ) .
1	the can size is like a redbull drink &apos;s. however , its sugar content is 34 grams. attached is a photo of the nutrional facts. in terms of its taste , in my opinion , it &apos;s quite tasty , sweet , a bit tangy and very orangish !
0	the noodles in the box were all broken. the sauce was over salted and did not have a good flavor. i threw out most of the skillet. i would recommend not purchasing this product.
0	i am very disappointed with this product because i could not see how many calories it has at the time i ordered it. i received it and now i can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. how could agave nectar be better than sugar ?
0	for tulsi original decaffinated tea the price is outragious for 1 box -- over $ 16.00 ! ! ! ! ! rip off ! ! ! what &apos;s the difference in cost for regular caffeinated and decaffinated to make the price too high. i don &apos;t get it.
0	just a fair warning , i &apos;ve found live , crawling bugs in these pyramid tea bags. i had bought mine from target , but wanted to warn others to check before they use this product.
1	i too have begun to drink only penta water unless absolutely neccessary to drink the other water. i find that the price of the water is cheaper from the actual website &#91; ... &#93; and i get free shipping. i feel better overall and wish i could get this stuff by the gallon. great product and well worth the price for the improved feeling of well being.
0	i was really looking forward to trying these chips since i love cheese but i was super disappointed ! i am a big fan of kettle chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain ! they are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that ... it &apos;s annoying. i do not recommend this flavor .. salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
1	so grateful for this ! ! what an amazing mix. it can be used to make some of the best gluten free products out there. what a break through for us gluten free individuals who miss real mixes. some of the other ones on the market just dont do the trick like this does : )
1	enjoying my java pods very much. easy and fast. medium strong to wake me up. i get positive comments on the convenience of making coffee.
1	i use this product daily , and it provides a steady stream of energy. i do not get jittery or crash. it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant.
1	i am addicted to this gum. it tastes so close to the real thing and doesn &apos;t lose flavor compared with the apple pie or strawberry. this best flavor of all of this series , along with the mint chocolate chip.
1	i received these wonderful beans today through amazon. i have not opened the vacuum sealed bag yet but the fragrance is divine. they are about 6-3 / 4 inches long and plump and soft. it looks like there are maybe 60-70 beans.
1	i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends. : ) ) my experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side. but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind. thanks to amazon for great discounts and i don &apos;t have to buy them from the store anymore.
1	these crackers are very delicious , have a wonderful texture , adapt well to any spread , and they are only 20 calories each--great for people watching their calories. they are very satisfying , and they contain whole grains in a tasty form.
0	reminds me of little debbie. its okay , but get something similar at your local store.
1	have had other brands like this before , and have always enjoyed them. these were a really good bargain on sale.
0	my dog loves puzzles and treat dispensing toys but this is the only one she dislikes. i don &apos;t really know what else to say except she &apos;s completely uninterested. might only work for big dogs who like to rip things apart.
1	this mild semi-soft / soft cheese has a range of subtle flavors that i have yet to find elsewhere. the price is worth it , though i can &apos;t afford to order it often , but the combination of this cheese with a really good white wine is truly a culinary delight !
0	very dissapionted in this oder.have had this coffee before from another source , but it wasn &apos;t avaliable at the time so i odered it thru ammazon.not the same coffee.very stale and weak.my hhusband and i both noticed it.wish i had not order the 50 count but something smaller
0	my daughter , who had used quaker instant oatmeal and liked it a lot a long time ago , tried this version and didn &apos;t like it at all , in fact didn &apos;t want to finish it. not sure why , maybe lots of new ingredients , some artificial.
0	we have only tried the chocolate and the raspberry syrups and they both tasted horrible ; both flavors were very bitter and ruined our coffee. the purchase was a total waste. i am so disgusted at myself for spending so much w / out knowledge of the product.
1	i really love this oatmeal , it is such a lovely treat. quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks , a must buy ! !
0	the plastic jug portion of this shattered. after the fact , i learned that the same thing happened to several friends. great idea , but not well built.
1	this was a cute , affordable set for my 2 y / o son &apos;s golf theme party. they were a great size for a half sheet cake and he &apos;s played with them as toys since his party.
1	whole grain ingredients and good tasting. most kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains , but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix. it &apos;s nice to have a treat that is more nutritious and still sweet enough for my sweet tooth ! there are several varieties of kashi cookies , and they are all good.
1	the best smooth tasting new coffee we have had since we have been to the islands , all good as ice coffee.
1	got 58 beans in the 1 / 2 lbs package which is a great value. they are moist so they are super fresh. great find.
1	i wasn &apos;t sure about these chips , but thought i would give them a try. these are tasty , crispy chips - and only 100 calories a bag ! i like all the flavors included in the variety pack. i definitely will buy again.
1	i love all of joray &apos;s flavors. watermelon is my favorite ! joray &apos;s fruit rolls are more natural than other fruit snacks.
0	these wafers taste incredible under normal circumstances but the six tins are a crumbled mess of smashed chocolate sticks. they should have written &apos; fragile &apos; on the box. it &apos;s literally a pile of chocolate goo and crumbs. i will not order again ...
1	product was timely delivered as advertised. there is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and i are currently enjoying. will order again.
1	i really loved the spicy flavor these had. i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite. if you aren &apos;t used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough.
1	i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings. since i liked it so well , i tried some of the others and i am now hooked ! they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time. the energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day , no matter how long.
1	i ordered these for my coffee themed wedding. when they arrived i had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good. i literally had to hide the box to the wedding ! they were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables. it was a great tasting product for the lowest price i &apos;ve seen !
0	my dog will try any treat at least once , but hates &quot; better than ears premium dog treats.your dog might be different.
1	due to my kid &apos;s food allergies i had to substitute eggs with ground flax with water , and 2 cups instead of one of rice milk , and some olive oil. made great tasty pancakes !
1	taste was decent , a little sugary , but very creamy otherwise. very happy with this product. i will be buying this product again. packaging interesting , as it &apos;s a giant box for the product to float around in until it delivers to your house.
0	based on other reiviews i purchased this creamer , i loved the idea of no refridgeration. it tastes great .. but .. not exactly like the refrigerated liquid version. it will do untill i use it up but i will not purchase it again.i am very picky about my morning coffee.
1	good product. but remember that you need some way of grinding because apparently we can &apos;t digest whole flaxseeds.
0	very very bold coffee. but that isn &apos;t the problem. i like bold , this just tastes horrible. i was able to try this flavor because it came in a sample pack with my keurig. i will not be buying ever. i wasn &apos;t even able to finish my cup.
1	these k-cups are just what my son wanted ! the price was excellent and the flavor is rich. i would recommend these to anyone wanting a good cup of instant hot cocoa.
1	i love snacks and grandpa po &apos;s originals are a great snack to satisfy a hunger craving. they are crunchy and have great flavor. it &apos;s hard to stop eating the whole bag in one sitting !
0	just opened greenies joint care ( individually sealed ) in december 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it. next one looked fine , but really supposed to trust these now ?
1	i thought the drink was delicious , but too sweet. i mixed it half n half with sugar-free ginger ale and loved it , however , i rarely drink sugared drinks. you need to make a sugar-free version.
1	this is a close second to my all-time favorite , jack links beef steakhouse steaks , which is the filet mignon of beef jerky. they &apos;re very similar in taste and price , but the steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly. still pretty awesome jerky , very tender , and not a hint of fat or gristle. bon appetit !
1	delicious , healthy , plus amazon is cheaper than if you buy them from mrs. mays actual website.
1	these 100 calorie cakesters are delicious ! both the vanilla and the chocolate are great , they satisfy those little &quot; sweet &quot; cravings and its only 100 calories for three little cakes !
1	this is a great product. we tried it at the beach the first time and loved it. the cashew crunch was not as good. we bought a case of the almond this week. just great !
1	these rolling papers are great they taste amazing and they burn slow and also prevent tar from running down the paper
1	i have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic. i highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy , but tasty. the mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing.
0	buy these k-cups only if you don &apos;t mind drinking your coffee through a slick of coffee grounds. the taste is fine ( though not fantastic ) , but i don &apos;t enjoy the surface slick or the sludge left over at the bottom of the cup ... and i &apos;m not happy that i &apos;m stuck either drinking this stuff or wasting my money by throwing the cups away.
1	love these snacks ! they &apos;re a little bit sweet , loads of crunchy almonds. am looking forward to trying the other varieties , too.
1	super tasty , super delicious. best tea ever , sweet and cinnamony. i actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags.
1	this is a favorite chocolate bar of several family members , made so by a visit to germany. hard to find in the states. glad to know where to get them.
1	i ordered these because i couldnt seem to find this size at the store. there were a couple skittle shells at the bottom of the bag from the shipping of the product , but everything else was fine.
0	this is a good name and a good value ; the texture and size of the jerky is fine , but be prepared for the salt. it ruined it for me.
1	i &apos;ve had trouble storing fresh basil because i learned a long time ago not to put it in the fridge. my cat is attracted to anything in the plant family ( with disasterous results ) . this keeps my basil fresh and the cat ignores it !
1	if you love jalapeno chips then kettle is a must try. nice and cruncy with the kick of jalapeno. delicious. addicting. recommended.
1	the disposakups are so easy and convenient to use. they are a great substitute when i run out of k-cups and don &apos;t want to run to the store to buy a replacement supply and pay higher in-store prices.
1	love this hot chocolate. made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink. creamy and tasty. will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates.
1	i have been using this curry paste for several years now , and it makes a great dish. although it doesn &apos;t beat eating indian out , its the best paste i have used for at home dishes. even though this is a &quot; hot &quot; paste , i would consider it mild.
1	cannot consider ourselves experts on north african or middle eastern cuisine , or having enough experience with ras el hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors. but the product was extremely fresh and of exquisite smell and taste so am very pleased with the purchase. will buy more when the time comes.
1	this is maybe the greatest coffee ever made. i have had this many time before in regular bean that i grind myself , but never in k-cups. tastes the exact same and its maybe my favorite coffee ever
0	i wish there was a zero star rate for this product. all the chocolate were completely melt , very disgusting. but you cant tell from outside , they just looks very normal. i don &apos;t have time to return this product , but i will never shop at amazon for chocolate
0	hershey has closed their reading , pa plant and moved the production of york peppermint patties ( along with other candies ) to mexico. although cutting thousands of us jobs and moving to another country evidently hasn &apos;t brought the price down , just the quality ( and probably safety ) of the product. look for pearson &apos;s mint patties instead , they &apos;re still made in the usa , and they &apos;re usually cheaper as well.
1	i received and have been using my disposakups for several days. i highly recomend this product. i fill up a dozen or so at a time and just pop them into the coffee maker when i want a fresh cup of coffee. the coffee comes out fresh and with no coffee grounds in the cup. who could ask for more ?
0	just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that &apos;s how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45
0	are your cats getting sick ? mine were vomiting and i finally traced it back to the salmon cat food. but it &apos;s not the salmon , it &apos;s the dye they put in the salmon. some cats simply can &apos;t tolerate it. three of my seven were that way. if you see this happening , there &apos;s a pretty good chance that your cat has an intolerance to the dye as well.
1	bought as a christmas present. smells like a milk shake. i might have to try it , might make a coffee drinker out of me !
1	we liked these. quite good , even if they &apos;re &apos; healthy &apos; @ 100 calories &amp; 3 whole fat grams a bag. my favorites are the plain , the others are very strong flavored , very zippy !
0	very tasty chips ( original and other flavors ) , but ones with salt flavor way too salty.not sure who likes so much salt in chips ..
1	this coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee. i like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings. the daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type.
1	i love a cup of hot choc. in the cold winter months. we live in penna. and it gets quite chilly here. the hot coc. is a little sweet for my taste , but i &apos;ve gotten used to it and enjoy a cup once in a while
1	i have so much fun watching my puppies asking for this chicken treats. they go crazy when i show them the blue package. these treats are small , easy to eat and does not have a bad smell. i recommend it , your puppies will be happy.
0	i did not like these potatoe chips. it &apos;s hot , and sweet , with an overwhelming taste of garlic. it &apos;s also a bit salty.
1	popcorn is very good. cant believe the difference between this popcorn and the regular stuff at the story. a very good purchase.
0	so i &apos;m a deployed soldier and there &apos;s a disappointing lack of any pumpkin here. i bought this so i could have that nice fall pumpkin coffee experience. i was sad to discover that this tastes not evenly remotely like pumpkin. the shipping time was the only thing that pleased me about this order.
0	all rice cereal contains arsenic which may cause cancer. check with your pedeatrician and see if you can switch to oatmeal instead which this brand carries as well. you can google rice cereal and arsenic for more information. i will not be feeding my baby any rice after reading about arsenic.
1	our baby loves loves this food. we actually mix a jar with 1-2 scoops of rice cereal for breakfast and he gobbles it up. earths best is the best !
1	we have three dogs and all of them love this food ! we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him , no more hot spots or tummy problems. i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping.
1	i like the item or i would not have ordered it , however , i ordered 100 and 100 was confirmed. when the order arrived it contained only 96 , four short. rather skimpy. i usually like to receive what i ordered and for which i paid full price.
1	these crackers are great--the beauty is not in their own flavor , but the fact that they are a perfect , crispy , low calorie , gluten-free delivery mechanism for all manner of spreads and slices. they don &apos;t come with over-powering artificial flavorings to compete with a topping of your choice. some of my favorites are ... peanut butter and banana or laughing cow cheese with turkey pepperoni.
1	this is a very very good tea , bearing the name sibu. english tea is really nice and really really really really really good.
0	this looked like an interesting toy but was unfortunately destroyed within 6 hours of first use. i do not recommend this for a giant breed. this may be a good toy for indoor supervised use.
0	loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form. this tea is black tea with prickly pear &quot; flavor &quot; . the shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea. if there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when i drink it. it just tastes like regular black tea. very disappointing.
1	these beans were amazing for the price. plump , moist and delightful smelling. made 1.5l of extract with them using silver rum for the alcohol.
1	these chews are tasty and chewy. the price is excellent for what you get. we have plenty around for ourselves and to share with family. great treat for little kids. plus they are good for you with no added junk. just licorice. great buy , great taste.
1	though it &apos;s hardly real coffee , my wife loves this stuff. she says it &apos;s like having hot caramel ice cream in a cup. amazon &apos;s 4-pk price is much better than store price ... if it can be found in a store.
0	didnt really enjoy these after wanting to try something other than aunt jemima &apos;s from dominicks. the pancakes tasted strange and sometimes forgettable , but it might have been due to the poor packaging they came in along with the syrup.
1	i &apos;ve always , always loved skittles ! they are sweet and chewy , and they will give you plenty of cavities if you &apos;re not careful ! ^ _ ^ enjoy them , and buy this 3.5 lb bag today ! 4.5 stars.
0	$ 136 for 12 boxes ? is this a rare item ? that &apos;s $ 11.33 a box. i think the item might be a bit overpriced.
1	best grapefruit soda on the market ! ! cost is good , but shipping is expensive. i still buy it every now and then for a special occasion !
1	great food ! i love the idea of one food for all ages &amp; breeds. t &apos;s a real convenience as well as a really good product. my 3 dogs eat less , have almost no gas , their poop is regular and a perfect consistency , what else can a mom ask for ! !
1	i love this stuff. it sweetens without affecting the blood glucose levels. now if i could only figure out how to make tequila i would be set. just kidding.
0	bought this at a local market , on sale thankfully , and am fully disappointed. it &apos;s bitter and doesn &apos;t have great olive flavor , though it is quite a beautiful green color. if you &apos;re looking for a mid-premium olive oil i &apos;d recommend alessi or lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range.
1	&lt; span class = &quot; tiny &quot; &gt; length : : 1 : 00 mins &lt; / span &gt; these cookies are so great ! watch our video to see how great they really are ! ! !
1	i live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. especially when i need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.
1	great product , fast shipment , the food product tasted great. none of the fortune cookies where opened. i would buy again from this seller !
0	i really didn &apos;t notice elmo on the package ? these are for kids more than adults. nothing wrong with flavor , but priced for kids that scream alot.
1	i enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far. my sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but i am glad i brought the variety pack anyway
1	i lived down in louisanna for 10 years , and community coffee is what you were served when you asked for a cup of coffee. here in iowa i can &apos;t buy the comm. coffee , so when i saw the ad to order through amazon i jumped at the offer. i got 3 bags of the hazalnut and i am in coffee heaven right now , thanks amazon.
1	my dog never met a meal she didn &apos;t love including this one. the price is very good , especially utilizing the subscription option. i make 2 / 3 of the food i feed my dog , it &apos;s very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality.
0	i have one of these and love it but i would never pay this much for it. got it a bed , bath , &amp; beyond for $ 24.99 and that was not a sale , just their regular price.
1	this is a nice mustard for sandwiches , potato salad , corned beef , roast beef or hot dogs. i have yet to find a single woeber product that i do not like. they are all tasty. i am glad to see that their distribution range has grown over the past ten years.
1	awesome baby food , i bought it online to save a few bucks , but some of the jars were broken when they arrived. 5 stars for the food , 1 star for packing and shipping quality.
0	carefull ! although the picture shows a box of gum , this is per pack price. also , mynaturalmarket &apos;s return policy does not include return $ coverage. as for the gum itself : great procuct.
1	never gave much thought to this treat until marshawn lynch came to town ... awesome have a big ole candy dispenser at work with a big seahawks sticker on it ... now we have matt flynn beast-mode cajun style ...
0	would not recomend this food , my 3 chihuahuas , an 1 greyhound eat this food free feed , an have lost excessive weight. they eat &amp; eat an still loose weight. my dogs are very healthy have been to vet , vet said its the food. i changed their diet an after only 1 wk have gained all the weight back they lost.
1	the product was exactly as advertised and fresh. unfortunately , i keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast. we need to reorder to keep up with &quot; demand &quot;
0	the laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. no other item inside our fridge turned bad.
0	i purchased two of these and they arrived with the package split and the items all over the box. i contacted amazon and they sent two more out , these also arrived with the packages open. amazon was very courteous and professional as always , i cannot review the item itself because the packaging is so horrible that i have given up on trying again.
1	i have twin girls , they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner. it was one of their favorite baby foods. great price.
0	i did not enjoy this soup ; i will try a different brand next time.
0	ugh , worst coffee ever. i &apos;ve been trying to find some good instant coffee that &apos;s cheap , but after this one i just gave up and gave in to buying the expensive starbucks like everyone else. if anyone has any other suggestions for cheap good tasting instant coffe , please comment below. there was nothing actually wrong with the shipment or product itself except for the terrible taste. definitely not my taster &apos;s choice though.
1	i use this to grow my cat grass every month or so. now that it &apos;s spring i can find the terra cotta pots at the stores again. i just keep two and alternate so he always has grass growing. he loves it , so i bought several packs at once , probably more than i &apos;ll need ! i get several batches out of each packet. none have been &quot; duds &quot; so far either.
1	i just got a pack of the key lime pie gum , and it is some of the best gum i &apos;ve had. it really tastes like key lime pie , almost eerily so , and is flavorful but not too strong. the idea of dessert flavored gum sounds a little like willy wonka , but it tastes really good , and i am looking forward to trying the other flavors.
1	we have tried a lot of different gf mixes and when i found this new mix from bisquick , i decided to try it. i made waffles for my family and even my kids couldn &apos;t tell they were gf. they almost taster better than my original wheat recipe. no strange texture or after taste.
0	this coffee has a really strange taste. not like pumkin pie at all. originally i didn &apos;t believe the people who wrote the reviews so i bought it. but it was true ! this coffee could be the worst ever. plus it is expensive. i don &apos;t like it at all.
1	my son loves the rice and lentil jars. it &apos;s not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice jars. i have it on order with subscribe and save + amazon mom and it always arrives nicely packaged.
1	what can you say about coffee , either you like it or you don &apos;t. i liked this coffee , although when i choose to review it i didn &apos;t notice it was decaf. that aside , it tastes fine ( made in my keurig ) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one.
1	not at all happy with the instant coffee taste of my cute little brewer , i began hunting for a solution . the disposakups were it ! ! my own fresh ground coffee - packed in tight in the disposakup - makes a good cuppa joe . easy to use and no mess . love them . shipping was fast and they are a good value in my opinion . thanks
0	cost was $ 48 at time of review. only $ 25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere ! sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. i will be comparison shopping a little more now.
1	very nice drink. i enjoyed it , especially when it was chilled. the flavor is powerful but not overpowering. i loved the bubbles. great drink.
1	i bought this because it was a very good price. it was really good though. i love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa. will keep buying this until they don &apos;t sell it anymore. it is really creamy. i like it best with 6 ounces of water , gives it a thicker feel.
1	i &apos;ve been using these for a couple of years now. i highly recommend these if you only need 1 cup of coffee.
0	when looking at the product , i thought that it would be a good way to entertain my dogs. unfortunately , after a few minutes of looking and pulling they gave up and never went back to the toy again. i think that the kong is a superior toy to hide food and keep dogs occupied.
0	items in this gift basket was delivered to people who called me to say &quot; could not eat any of it , because everything was old and stale. &quot; i was sad and disappointed. time and effort , as well as money to get this , only to find out - terrible.
1	my husband loves hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high , i used to only give it to him once a week , but now i can afford to give him his favorite everyday ! he loves the rich flavor !
0	i have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china i find disturbing. regardless , the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd , plastic texture. the duck and chicken are both great--but i will be investigating the source of the food.
1	the order arrived as advertised. i have had only a few chances to use it , but it is awesome. the flavor is exactly what i hoped for ! it may take me a while to finish the entire gallon , but i will definnantly order again !
1	enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste. the 16-count pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
1	as someone who goes through lots of thyme ( i use it in everything except cereal ) , i was pleasantly surprised to see this product on amazon at a very reasonable price. looks , smells and tastes just like any other thyme but you can not beat not running to the grocery store and paying about 5-10x more for a tiny bottle which would last maybe 2 weeks in my house : ) .
0	this , lavassa tierra , tastes like very bad diner coffee. it is bitter and muddy tasting ; totally terrible. i am ordering something else , pitching the rest of this crap and drinking tea until the replacement arrives.
1	this tea is what it is supposed to be , it is good , the packaging was good , and the tea is excellent
1	very tasty chips , healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. in fact , the taste is better than most regular chips i &apos;ve had. would highly recommend this product ! if you had to choose , my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar , followed by salt and pepper. ironically , the original flavor was my least favorite , probably because i was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer.
0	could not get the bags to &quot; pop &quot; any edible pork rinds. i tried several bags with no results. i finally had to throw them out. i was very dissapointed with this product.
1	a co-worker gave me a couple of the harney &amp; sons fine teas hot cinnamon spice sachets to sample. the cinnamon spice flavor is wonderful. these teas are not available at my local grocery stores. i was glad to find them for a reasonable price on-line.
1	well , after trying a lot of brands , this is probably the best beef jerky i ever tasted !
1	i love using this to sweeten tea , coffee , etc. it tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste.
1	this is the best hot chocolate next to cadbury bought in europe. our 13 yr old would never drink her chocolate milk until we switched to this ( unfortunately we don &apos;t have a steady supply of cadbury &apos;s ) . it &apos;s great !
1	tried this item liked it. this item was cheaper to get than buying at the local store , easier to get and it has a longer shelf life than what i was getting. around here driving 30 miles one way is local. p.s. these can make great mini pizzas
1	if you &apos;ve never tried any of ghirardelli &apos;s hot cocoa products you are in for a treat ! made with milk , the cocoa is far superior to any other cocoa product on the market. i don &apos;t drink coffee , but have a cup of this every morning. when made in the froth au lait hot chocolate / latte maker , you will get the best cup of hot cocoa you ever had.
1	my husband eats gf , and i don &apos;t , and its so hard to find him goodies , and hes always tempted to eat mine. now he has some thing i &apos;m tempted to eat , i thought they were ok cold but if heated up they really taste yummy.
1	great low cal snack ... satisfies the crunchy , snacky , salty cravings without high calories. all flavors are good ; the cheddar is a little too seasoned for my taste.
0	we love happybaby products , our twins like most of them. unfortantely this is nothing like the others. very dry , paste like. babies refused to eat it.
1	i was able to use this gluten free product and make it taste better than any restaurant by bringing the buttermilk to room temperature and separating the yokes from the whites and adding additional baking powder and baking soda to the recipe. i love it. served with pure maple syrup brings it out of this world.
1	we have been looking for pesto that tastes as good as what we had in tuscany. this is from the same region as our favorite. the consistency is just a bit runny. it has moderate chunks of garlic. it was quite tasty !
0	the product has very little white chocolate and tastes like cardboard. i tasted one bar and threw the other nine out.
1	very good transaction and omaha food was sent properly. i already left one feedback.
1	great mixed for belgium waffles , family thinks it &apos;s the best. must try it and order it from amazon. i let friends know to use this product.
0	this used to be a great food , but they &apos;ve changed the formula and my dogs have suffered. their customer service is very rude. my dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula. explosive diaherra , vomiting , fur became dull. change it back canidae ! ! !
1	these chips are quite tasty and the price is right. packaged very well , would buy again.
0	this tastes nothing like pumpkin , let alone pumpkin pie. it just tastes like spicy cleaning solution to me. some may be a fan but i am certainly not.
1	&lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b000i6g2oo &quot; &gt; barry &apos;s bakery french twist , wild raspberry , 4.5-ounce box ( pack of 12 ) &lt; / a &gt; i really love this product. it is not available in our area. we discoverd it in the north while visiting friends. it is low cal and good for diabetics who need a sugar fix. keep a good supply for future orders.
1	my dog loves it and she doesn &apos;t scratch at her ears anymore ( she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection ! )
1	this coffee mix is so easy to make and taste great. i enjoy all their flavors as my kids do too. hard to keep around. buying a box of it at a time helps.
0	been buying and enjoying romanoff fish egg products for years and thought that i received spoiled product. the new sweet caviar is one of the worst things i have ever tasted. do not buy it , unless you want a fishy dessert.
1	if you love garlic , i recommend this flavored oil. it is true to its name. i was not expecting it to be so strong , so if i use it for cooking or dipping bread , i will mix it with some unflavored olive oil in the future.
0	i will not buy this again. this tasted more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate to me. it was way to sweet ! it is not &quot; quality &quot; chocolate in my opinion. it tasted like that cheap chocolate they put in those colorful dots that come thin plastic holders. actually , i prefer that chocolate to this. if you are looking for real dark chocolate this is not for you.
1	they taste pretty good. i eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from omaha steaks. it makes a great meal.
1	i absolutely love this product ! i use it on chicken , beef and as veggie spread ! its also good in recipe &apos;s for a little extra kick !
0	this food might have great contents , but my 7 1 / 2 lb , 11 / 2 yr old poodle doesn &apos;t like the taste. she &apos;s not a picky eater.
0	you have to put a lot of sugar in this to make it taste good. the coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. next time i am going for raspberry flavored coffee ... cause the chocolate is like poop. yuck.
0	i have purchased these gummi candies in the past and not had a problem , but these strawberries tasted terrible and i ended throwing them out.
1	my dogs ( and some other dogs i like to spoil too ) just love these. they are their special treats.
1	i was very pleased to stumble upon this brand , as it is difficult to find &quot; healthy &quot; snacks for families that don &apos;t contain gmo ingredients. these were a big hit with kids and grown-ups alike ; added bonus that they are low in calories and gluten-free. i would highly recommend the sweet potato flavor , as well as the brand in general. great new company !
0	this mesquite lime flavor is so horrible ! please spare yourself from the disgusting mouth experience. the other flavors are pretty good. this is like some nasty fake lime flavor that is super overwhelming. am i eating lemon pledge or something ? couldn &apos;t finish one bite. hope i don &apos;t chuck.
0	i ordered these to take on a trip for my 10 month old son , they were way overpriced to begin with and when they came they were stale and rancid. our trip was to hawaii , where everything costs more and i found these crackers for less than half of the price sold here.
0	i did not care for this product at all , i thought it was the same tea my sisters and i use to drink when we were in elementary school. i found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.
0	i thought i would try this , but i am sticking with my uncle joes jerk sauce ! ! ! this is sweet &amp; not hot .... should be hot if they are going to put jerk on the label
0	i tried this to see if it would taste the same or close to duncan donuts &amp; i &apos;m sorry but it doesn &apos;t come close. at first it taste good but then there &apos;s some after taste.
1	if you &apos;re looking for a very light , refreshing coffee , this one is for you. nice coconut flavor without any bitterness. may be too light for some people.
1	i like the rich dark smooth taste of the grove square cocoa. it is the best i have found in k-cups and i have been on auto delivery for at least a few months now. delicious !
0	my fondarific buttercream wedding white fondant , 5-pounds is as hard as concrete ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i just received this today , i can &apos;t use it , obviously , i have a wedding on saturday , what should i do ? help ! this a non return item , what should a customer do ?
0	excellent product , flimsy packaging by mfr ( biscuits crumble when opening the packet ) , good packaging ( box and air pillows ) by amazon. however this time amazon shipped items a month prior to the product expiration date which is a form of dumping rather than returning to the mfr for newer product.
0	they were okay when you first bit into them but then chewing them made them gummy &amp; nasty. i &apos;d rather do without.
1	just returned from italy and was told these little chocolates were the favs of the italians--perfect little two-chocolates for gifts -- and gloomy days -- or happy days --
0	if you are going to take noni take pure noni , not one with juice added , i didn &apos;t read that it contained the raspberry juice
0	i love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. rice can be a pain to make , with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave , it was really appealing ! really i should have known better though ... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. the smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning , couldn &apos;t possibly be good for you ....
1	it &apos;s just sugar in the raw , it &apos;s flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it &apos;s suppose to be better for you or something. i just wish the bags were resealable.
0	i bought this cereal for my kids ( ages 6 and 7 ) who can &apos;t eat gluten any more. they won &apos;t eat it. i think it passes to at least finish the box but my kids would be happy to throw it out.
1	organic , and loaded with calories , fat and protein , this the only baby food with meat that my picky little one will happily eat. i &apos;ve found that very few groceries carry this near my home ( and i live in metropolitan seattle ) and so i &apos;ve resorted to ordering it by the case from amazon. the free 2 day shipping rocks !
0	my husband and i both like wasabi but .. we don &apos;t care for these crackers at all. the flavouring is a dusting on the cracker and it does have bite but to me it seems like a bitter non food chemical bite. not like the wasabi we know.
1	i originally found these at a target out of my home town. i fell in love with them as part of my weight watcher &apos;s plan. they are a good snack alternative when i crave something salty. i could not find them where i live so i purchased them from the pop chips web site which took me through amazon. yummy !
1	this chips are perfect for a snack without having greasy fingers leftover. all the flavors are great with my favorite being the vinegar and sea salt.
1	i got the licorice at a cheese shop in new york and by the time i got home it was all gone. so got on the computer and found and bought some. that &apos;s how much i liked it. i have not done the before and do not regret buying it. yummmmmm.
0	even after shaking the cup and only using 6 ounces of water , this &quot; hot cocoa &quot; ( pretty sure there &apos;s not a lick of real chocolate in it ) still tastes horrible.
1	i liked the milk chocolate version , so tried this. it is just as good , and with the more intense chocolate flavor , appeals to my chocolate desires.
1	of the erin baker products , the fruit &amp; nut mini breakfast cookie is my favorite ! i have one mini breakfast cookie ( about 100 calories ) with a cup of coffee in the morning and i feel satisfied and ready to start the day. very healthy , low in caloreis , and super delicious is what makes the product work for me. try it , you &apos;ll like it.
1	good product and reasonable price compared with local store. for people who use it everyday , it &apos;s a great deal ... i would recommend it to everyone who loves thyme flavor.
0	have a 6-month old black labrador. she destroyed toy in less than a week. when the container broke , it was very sharp.
0	starbucks caramel brulee latte ( that &apos;s available around christmas ) is my favorite coffee ever. i wasn &apos;t expecting this to be the same , but i hoped i could &quot; doctor &quot; it up. it is actually very weak and with adding anything i just made it weaker. i still have a whole box so i &apos;ll continue to try to tweek it , but unless a miracle happens , i wont &apos; buy it again.
1	this is a wonderful and very handy product. i &apos;m thrilled by all the yummy ways this can be used. my aunt , who lived in ireland for 7 years , said they used it all the time and loved it.
1	you can purchase this for $ 35.00 including free shpping straight from penta &apos;s website. i really enjoy drinking this. i can see a difference with my everyday life.
0	bahlsen delice cookies , 3.5-ounce boxes ( pack of 12 ) very disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients. i am allergic eggs and as per your listing , there is no mention of eggs and when i received the product , on the box the cookies one of the ingredient is egg.
1	the 6 hour power energy shot does just what it says. a lot of times i only drink half the bottle to achieve the mental alertness that i look for. it &apos;s one of the best energy shots out there when you figure in price , taste and effectiveness.
0	i had a second plant to replace the first one. it to came in sad shape , i should of went to a local nursery at least then i would of got a good plant. dont waste your time with this vender.
1	well packaged , and alot of beans for the price ( 50 + ) . using them to make home made vanilla extract. wounderfull flavor. will buy again.
1	hard to find locally. great price , especially with the free shipping. have enough to share with family and friends.
0	i purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks. it has very little &apos; coffee &apos; taste , and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate. similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking. i will not be purchasing this coffee again. my suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else.
1	there are very seldom any unpopped kernels , which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. not a whole lot to say about popcorn. i always buy from you guys and will continue to.
0	i had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular innova dog food. i fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced ! he was going up to 10 times a day ! unbelievable ! this just goes to show how much filler is in this food. would never recommend.
1	very good. very tasty and authentic flavor ! i ordered these last minute for christmas , not knowing if they were going to arrive on time. they arrived at my house on christmas eve.
0	my husband just read on the box that raisin bran is now made in mexico. i was shocked. i don &apos;t feel confident that the quality is the same as if it was made in the usa. we cancelled our subscription.
1	this is the only flavor of switch i have tried. it tastes just fine and is not overly sweet. the carbonation is nice. more importantly though , this makes a fantastic mixer to use with vodka.
1	my dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater. i felt i was giving him healthy food with no fillers. i also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly. not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great.
1	these are the best skinless boneless sardines that i &apos;ve tried and they are very reasonably priced. they remind me a little more of tuna fish than sardines , but in a mild , rather than bad , way and are very firm for water-packed fish. i especially like these mixed with salsa. they work out to $ 1.57 / can or .36 / oz if you choose the longer , but free , shipping.
0	this is the most horrible stuff. bacon ? please ! ! i bought the 3 pack and gave 2 to friends. we all threw them away after one taste.
0	this is the first k-cup and tea product from twinings that no one enjoyed in our family. if i could have returned it , i would have after the first cup , but this item is not returnable.
0	tried the original chips - they are crispy , tasty but too salty for me. both chips and packet are light !
1	this is a very tasty and refreshing little drink. one of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere. i only wish it were bigger , because it &apos;s that good.
1	the grass sprouted quickly , with a great germination rate. the cats love it , so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while i was out of town. the pot was upside down for at least a day , and it looked like the grass was all going to die. however , a week later it has almost fully recovered , so it &apos;s pretty hearty.
1	dogs love the taste and i love the company. especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home.
0	i must be a bit of a wuss , because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste. typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor. i don &apos;t find this to be the case with this soup. any flavor is killed off by the burn.
1	i was able to do so much with these crackers ! they &apos;re easy to spread on and stack and put toppings on ! i definitely enjoyed them and so did all my friends = d
1	i love this brand of dandelion root tea. the tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular. transaction went smooth like always. so glad to hear amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door. i have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but i do a lot of it on amazon.com
1	this small can of juice is tasty ! the carbonation makes this beverage very delightful , and the juice is not too sugary. it is good to see this drink in the market. although i would have liked a larger size container so i could drink more at a time , the switch drink is loaded with tangerine goodness ! hooray !
1	if you like coconut water , then you will love taste nirvana ! ! ! it has bits of coconut in it. not just a few , it has a lot of little bits.
1	these have become a wonderful alternative to those afternoon cravings for salt , and or sugar. they have texture and flavor , and a bag hits the spot. i would highly recommend these if you are looking for an alternative to the junk from candy machines.
1	i have had to change my diet and now have better health. these are very tasty.
1	we enjoy community coffee when we go to new orleans. i was glad to see it available in your online store
0	there &apos;s an old saying that a bargain is not a bargain if there is no use for the item. while the price of this made it seem a very attractive ; it goes to waste since the cats do not eat it.
0	look at some of the main ingredients : partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils. this stuff may taste sweetly good , but the hydrogenated oils wreak havoc on your body. you &apos;d be a terrible hostess poisoning guests with this stuff. well , unless you have very bad guests : p
1	i was pleased to discover that switch orange tangerine is actually quite tasty. more please to find out that it contains no sugar , corn syrup or artificial flavors. what it does have is several healthy ingredients. i highly recommend it.
1	montebello pasta has been made at the monastero di montebello in isolo del piana , italy since 1388. i love italian food but have severe digestive and allergic problems , and their pasta is friendly to me , and it tastes better than any other pasta i have eaten , and that &apos;s a lot , it is one of my favorite foods.
0	2.99 per , can 14 oz , too expensive refund is reduced by their shipping to customer and the customer pays for return shipping .... may as well keep the product ....... shipping weight says 11 pounds in description. one can is 14 oz ... per math calculation , that should be about 12 cans. ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
1	hands down my all time favorite iced tea. i typically prefer loose tea , but the taste of this tea is wonderful ! the pouches are so easy to use and make clean up a breeze.
1	best dipping chocolate ever ! i dipped strawberries , pretzels marshmallows its wonderful. my whole family loves them. great to bring out to friends or occasions ! dont forget the wax paper , otherwise it will stick to your plate !
0	i bought these chips thinking that they are &quot; all natural &quot; per their description of &quot; no preservatives , no artificial flavors or colors. &quot; when i received them i checked the ingredients , and they contain &quot; yeast extract , &quot; which is synonymous with msg ( yeast extract contains processed free glutamic acid ) . i will never purchase this product again.
1	these snacks are very different than , say , slim jims. they are moist and seems less processed than many of the convenience store meat snacks out there. there was a nice hint of spice laced with honey. i would say they tasted and had a texture that i might have expected in a more expensive product. i will buy them again and will recommend them to friends and family.
1	roland s &amp; b sardines are the best you can buy and believe me , i &apos;ve tried them all. also .... amazon &apos;s price is half what i had been paying.
1	i like this product so much i have it delivered monthly ! so happy to be drinking this at work while my co-workers are stuck with pop ! it &apos;s so refreshing and revitalizing ! the only coconut water flavor i like is pineapple ! transports easily and stores easily with the screw-on top.
1	i &apos;ve tried a bunch of them and the taste of this product is outstanding. even the folks behind the counter at my gym commented on it and they sell a competing product. give it a try , you won &apos;t be disappointed.
1	this brand is by far the best k cup hot cocoa not that that says much , but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest.
0	my baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. so , when i couldn &apos;t find the jars at the store i was at , i tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. they are not. she doesn &apos;t like these. maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. looking for more mac n cheese jars.
0	i opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke , i was very disappointed. they did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking. you are better off buying them from a store around your area.
0	where is the nutrition information for this product ? what may be low sugar to one &apos;s purpose may not be low enough for another ...
1	my local harris teeter stopped carrying and said they could not get this product any more. so happy to find it on amazon.com ! !
1	they taste so good. easy on my stomach when i am running. help keep my energy up on long runs. love them ! ! !
1	the pods worked as described. i did not have overflows. i found the best way to secure the top is to press the raised area in the center of the top. wish they were sold in larger quantities
0	in order for tea to be labeled &quot; decaff &quot; is must be under 0.4 % caffeine when residue levels are tested. a tea at 2 % caffeine is not decaff. non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5 % caffeine. so ... at 2 % caffeine , this is a caffeinated tea , with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf.
1	thank you thank you thank you ..... i have an intolerance for gluten and bisquick is my hero. i have tried some of those other packed product and invested in loads of ingredients to make my own mix but &quot; bisquick &quot; has saved me from myself. again thank you thank you thank you
1	grove square milk chocolate cocoa k cups are great ! i usually make hot cocoa from scratch with milk over the stove. i thought this was easier and delicious. to add creaminess i put in either a splash of milk or a shot of whipped cream--perfect !
1	this item has an awesome chocolate flavor. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k-cups. great product
1	i am amazed how well these little cups taste. these kcups taste very well. this hot chocolate taste great and are ready in one minute.
1	a great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle , rio. he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm.
1	the cups to make my own coffee k-cups work fine. if there had been free shipping it would have been better , but i will order again and look for a way to not pay 1 / 2 the price of the product just for shipping.
1	great for risotto. creates creamy finished product , while maintaining a good &apos; al dente &apos; bite , better than any other rice i have used.
1	found this item quite good : it was sweet and slightly crunchy. all in all , a delightful product. it arrived in excellent condition , no dents and no dings. perhaps the packaging has improved.
1	this is absolutely the best sauce for making carolina barb q. i , ve looked for a long time and am glad that i finally found the best.
1	always wanted to make my own hummus and eggplant dip - this brand of tahini i &apos;d never tried before or seen in supermarkets , so i decided to order and try it .... excellent by itself or in recipes ! highly recommended.
0	please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product ! we just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting ! not buying again unless the change back to the old version !
1	these cups are usable as stated. they are exactly what i was looking for which was a less expensive method to have coffee. they do leak slightly but not too bad. not sure if it makes the hole &apos;s a little larger than the prepackaged cups. but on the high side , i do get the have the coffee that i want , the way i want it. which is great.
0	this product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important ! i prefer to drink my grey goose straight ; however , on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice. this product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice. it &apos;s not worth it ! ! the after taste is worse ! !
1	the price was as fantastic as the taste. so convenient to make and no messy powder that is hard to dissolve. no major cleanup to deal with either. highly recommended !
0	i love italian roast realized - and french roast- this is very expensive. i ju purchasest that i &apos;m on amazon - and i don &apos;t purchaise things from amazon.
1	i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good. my daughter loves it. she gets all excited when i make it for her
0	i totally love popchips - but the sea salt and vinegar just has too much vinegar taste for me. i felt like i was eating just vinegar. i took the rest to work and some people like the flavor and some said just to much vinegar for them.
1	this is great french roast. for whatever reason , it is also cheaper ( in 24-count ) than the other green mountain coffee roasts.
1	this is the best coffee we &apos;ve ever had. i run the american pavilion in cannes and weaver &apos;s was by far and away our most popular coffee sponsor ! hundreds of people come to the pavilion every day looking for american coffee and they were not disappointed. we did a booming business this year ! buy it ! you &apos;ll be so happy you did ! julie
0	love this cereal , but i buy a 35 oz box at costco for $ 7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $ 2 / box coupon. its too high here
1	i keep trying other brands .... cheaper brands. stupid me ! this ginger is soooo worth the money. tender , moist and never a let down.
0	amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. it is not a stock image. i created it and put my website name on it ... looneystuff.com ... for use on my website. i have asked them to take my image down from this listing.
1	i ordered this italian flour after reading an article about some of the issues with american wheat. it is light , and everything i &apos;ve made with it from cookies to pizza crust has been delicious. it was shipped very quickly.
1	i was actually surprised at how good these muffins taste ! i have reordered a case. and they are gluten free.
0	this product taste like an orange juice , an artificial one but with less sugar and less flavor i didn &apos;t like it.
1	i use these for training treats. i have a large and small dog and this works for both of them. they are all natural and my pups love the taste. i highly recommend these ! i also tried the three dog bakery apple oatmeal woofers and those were a big hit.
1	i bought this for my daughter &apos;s new microwave popcorn popper as a christmas gift , and she says that it is delicious , but pops up smaller than other popcorn. she likes it a lot.
1	based on other reviews , i tried these kavli products. they &apos;re great low-fat snacks. these are great with natural peanut butter and jelly between 2. recommended.
0	we really like the happy bellies cereal , but this time , it came at a price ! it arrived smelling like cigarette smoke ! i won &apos;t even feed it to my baby ! the box smelled horrible , and i just figured it was the delivery driver. then when i opened it up , the canisters smelled too. i don &apos;t think this is standard practice-as we &apos;ve ordered the cereal in the past with no problems.
1	my dog absolutely loves these ! i try to give one to him everyday , either in the morning or before we go to bed at night. it doesn &apos;t take him long to finish it off ... but long enough to put dishes away or brush my teeth. : )
1	i used to buy this product at the local walmart , but they no longer carry it. it delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder , and i use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical ... on my burgers , in potato salad , etc.
1	this was the best deal ever. the delivery was fast , the chips are delicious and very fresh. love it : )
0	this hot chocolate is ok but not nearly as rich and smooth as the cafe escapes products. we tried it out because they were less expensive but once they are al gone we &apos;ll be going back to the cafe escapes brand.
1	this is a great assortment and price ... i only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint , so i add extract. nice cocoa flavor to all , tho. reminds me of &quot; homemade &quot;
1	we love these sugar cubes in the office. they aren &apos;t your grandmother &apos;s sugar cube. they have a rugged appearance ( can sugar cubes be considered rugged ) . and we combine them with the white sugar cubes from la perruche.
1	if you like flavored coffee this is one you must try. rich taste but not strong. smells wonderful. so good you will want to stay home and sip on it all day.
0	i can only buy these online and they are always burnt. my fur person loves these. i wrote to the company and they said there is nothing wrong with them but compared to some of the others , they are definitely burnt.
1	i love this stuff and only get it through amazon. it arrived on time and good condition and i enjoy it.
0	we always thought the science diet ( hill &apos;s ) cat food was good. but , no ! ! ! ! ! my two cats all developed kidney stones and one died of crf after eating this brand food for several years. we have switched the food for our cats , and will never use any hill &apos;s product for sure !
1	nice and smooth. hopefully , gf or maxwell will not discontinue this flavor like they have my other two. they losing my business !
1	these tastes good. if it &apos;s not fried , not bad for you , and tastes good , then why not eat them ? of course , not a lot at once , but these are great healthier snacks.
1	baby loves to feed herself and these are a great on the go option. we have tried other brands ( gerber ) but this is her favorite by far and i don &apos;t feel bad giving them to her as i know that they are high quality. hubby tries to steal a few away here and there as well : )
1	you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at costco now , just 7bucks sth &lt; a href = &quot; http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b0042tr2we &quot; &gt; sogo sweet rice cakes japanese style mochi assorted flavor cannister &lt; / a &gt;
1	there are literally hundreds of jerky type products out there. this is simply my favorite. real strips of beef , not ground up hamberger , that tastes like meat instead of preservatives without teriyaki or any other flavoring or sauce. good price , good product and great taste. you &apos;ll be happy with this one. when i &apos;m looking for a non sugary snack , i reach for this first.
0	i would never describe these as berry burst. they are sickenly sweet ( and i have a huge sweet tooth ) with a weird chemical-like after taste. these sat around the house for a month until we finally threw them out.
0	these taste synthetic. there is a big difference between mashing your own potatoes and the contents of this package. the second ingredient is powdered cellulose and that &apos;s what they taste like - something that just can &apos;t or shouldn &apos;t be digested.
1	what a great gift ! i bought it for a couple of foodie friends and they loved it. it came beautifully packaged ready to gift. i would totally recommend it.
1	i love san marzano tomatoes and cento &apos;s are great. they have the greatest , sweetest taste ever. worth ever penny and than some.
1	like the disposakup lids , the disposakup set is just as good if not better. if you tossed your previous keurig kcups , this set will take care of you. i will definitely be purchasing them again.
0	i bought this for my 16 pound whoodle , and within 4 days she was able to crack the bottle and ripped apart the rope that was attached to it. i wouldn &apos;t purchase it again , but the concept was good.
1	it &apos;s all natural real food that you can see the difference. my cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty.
0	the product itself was inedible and mostly crumbs. it even smelled bad. the star is there because of the packing material. my cats loved the packing material. played in it for days. i &apos;d almost buy the product again for that packing material.
1	this is the best-tasting brown rice i have ever had. kind of a nutty flavor. this is the only rice i have ever had that tastes great all by itself.
1	my son loves them and i can give them to him knowing they melt in his mouth so won &apos;t choke and they are good for him too.
1	love all the flavors ! ! ! ! ! just the right size package and taste great ! ! ! ! ! give them a try you will love them also ! ! ! ! !
0	too fragile for my pup. he bit right through the rubber &quot; rope. &quot; i think it lasted about 45 minutes. granted he is an adolescent amstaf , but i still had higher hopes. we are sticking to our kongs ( filled with low sodium chicken broth and frozen overnight ) .
1	it appears a little watery , but the taste is not bad at all. if you have kids that are as fascinated by the keurig as you are , they &apos;ll probably enjoy this.
1	we love kettle chips lightly salted and don &apos;t feel guilty eating them ! we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money. we have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
0	if you love really strong coffee you will more than likely love this flavor. i tried running another 8 ounces of water through the same k-cup before i could drink this one. this flavor is smooth and it is not bitter , it &apos;s just way too strong for me. i finally added a little milk and some hershey &apos;s chocolate syrup and it was good that way.
